0,Put the Essays in an e-book,amnhearth-002,1,resolves,"During the recent Human Evolution: Past and Present course it was announced that the best of the final essays would be put into an e-book for distribution. While I haven't seen this come out yet it is a great idea. There is so much effort put into studying personal localities across the world I think it would be a fascinating read. It would be a shame for all that information to be in an electronic form but still unreachable. Is this possible?

2,Quiz deadline confusion,amnhearth-002,1,resolves,"Today I discovered this course and decided to sign up. The Syllabus and Grading Policy page stated "" You can take each quiz as many times as youâd like. Quizzes will close two weeks after they open, and answers will be available at that time."" However when I went into the Quiz for week one it said the deadline was already past. I can understand having a strict deadline for the peer-reviewed assignment, but why does the page say there are two weeks for the quiz when there seems to be only one week? Or did the course start 2 weeks ago? Please clarify. 
I'd like to know too as I just did the quiz, got 9/10 but it doesn't count because it was 3 hours past the deadline, which I thought was much later on.

3,HELP--Anyone with good internet?,amnhearth-002,5,resolves,"Hi, I have spent the last three hours trying to download my geology assignment for week 1 #MATH, and then you can upload it...? Thanks!! 
 I can try for you. When I uploaded mine, it was very tedious uploading pics, it was very sloooow. Did you try uploading text only on first go round, then adding pics after? Anyway my email is kelliec@#URLREF, what is yours? 
 Hi Michaela It occurs to me that YOU may not be able to earn Signature Track credit for the course if the assignment is uploaded by ME under my user name. I'd still be willing to do it, but this is something to consider. I do know that the pics must be attached individually with the ""Pic"" button in the post box, you cannot upload them as part of another document. Good luck either way

4,It is not my fault that your site can not with hold the load,amnhearth-002,1,resolves,Hi - I repeat my request. It is not the short videos that I have to see. It is the sources that you gave and the main video is 88 minutes. This lasted a few days because of internet load. I am new in this field and I have to study all the material that you ask to study. I am doing it around the clock. I enclose the result of my quiz and it is very disappointing that you cant delay the time of doing the quiz. Please check in other courses and you'll find that there are courses with no time limit. What does it mean to you that time is passed? Are doing something with the results of the quiz so early in the course? It is the same result if you delay the time out. In any case student who started late are losing the chance to certificate.

6,This week it was not possible to cope with the material,amnhearth-002,1,social,Hi - I am trying to read and see all the material you are asking us to do. There was a video of 88 minutes. This video was not accessible. The internet pace could not hold the amount of students in this course and it took me hours to see all the video. The same happened with the other videos. This course work is too much. Assignment + Quiz. I am doing step by step and I came late to do the quiz. I think the course is wonderful and I'll try keep on although the conditions can't allow me to cope with the material. I'd like the management of this course to be more flexible about date of work. And give us a little more time space to fulfill the mission. You are dealing with billions of years and suddenly you are standing on the minute.

R1=6,400 km =6.4*10^#MATH If you combine this 2 vectors you get a shift which is away from the sun.

So these (the bottom 4) are likely more closely evolutionarily related than these (top) 4 sequences and this can tell us the evolutionary history of a set of sequences that have been aligned.""

22,When in relation to the three types of sections does non-synonymous/ synonymous mutations occur,bioinfomethods1-001,3,resolves,"Is it write to argue that synonymous mutations may only occur in a balancing selection whilst, non-synonymous mutations only occur in +ve or -ve selections? 
Organisms tend to use some codons more than others, and other organisms prefer different ones, even if they code for the same amino acid.This is known as codon bias.So, even synonymous changes can be under (weaker) selective pressure. Also, a non-synonymous mutation could have little to no impact on fitness, but might increase in frequency due to random drift. 
=""Is it write to argue that synonymous mutations may only occur in a balancing selection"" If I understood question correctly - no, it's not right. Synonymous mutations occur constantly, because they are under almost zero selection pressure. 
The effects of changing to synonymous codons might be subtle, but it seems they aren't insignificant: see e.g.  #URLREF#URLREF #URLREF#URLREF #URLREF#URLREF #URLREF#URLREF

 Hi Kenneth and Melanie, Oracle just issued on the 15th of this month another step up in effort to secure Java. (And it is particularly stringent on Macs for some reason.) There is a work around. See here . (See here  for the technical details from Oracle.)  To get around it you want to download the '.jnlp' file to your drive and then follow the steps here   under ""Adding the site to the Exception Site List"" to add the exception. You want to add the exception for  #URLREF:80/ . After you add it, you'll be able to right-click on the "".jnlp"" file you downloaded and choose ""Open with..."" and select ""Java Web State"" from the list. Click through to say you are sure you want to open it and now it should run. Wayne 
Hello Wayne ! Thank you so much for your post ! I am on Windows 7 PRO 64 bits and I followed your instructions as for MAC OS Java, and as our Java interface is almost identical, it worked well ! However, when I ran WebACT, I get a screen that doesn't look at all like the example in the course pdf ! This is what I got when I tried the webACT application on my MAC mini also ! I tried a few display options but to no avail. I have a Dell Optiplex 9010, 16 GB RAM and a Nvidia Quadro 600 Video card, so I think I should have the specs to be able to run the application. Am I doing something wrong ? Probably something to do with the display configuration ? Thanks ! Ken :) 
Hi Ken, Your image looks like what I saw.  The example in the lab pdf is between humans and mice. A good deal distant in evolutionary terms. I think you did everything right. In the example in the lab, we are looking at organisms with the same ATCC identifier. Scroll right to around '892800' to get the view much like he had in the summary, post-lab discussion talk slides. I found depending on where I clicked on the screen I could toggle the color red or yellow. That is interesting adding the exception worked for you on Windows too. I had been told Java applets were still working on at least one person's updated Java on Windows. But maybe he spoke to soon. Since I have been advising people how to keep #URLREF working, it is useful to know how many systems are affected and that the work around works there. Wayne",,5,0

Because I don't know yet, so my next question is where can I see the value of E of the last hit? Please see my snapshot below. That could be great if you can take the snapshot(s) to show me. Thank you. 
i also had trouble answering this weeks 1st question as in my graphical summary the last hit had a value of exactly zero ( see screenshots for search strategy and graphical summary) so I wonder if there is any variation in #URLREF the instructor does as on the pdf files of the lab , Existence: Extension ratio is 11:1 whereas my Blastp default is set at 10:1. No matter what however, the result is always the same for my browser : i.e. last is both ways E=0 or b. The settings for graphical summary are variable? I enclose my search strategy and snapshots of the results. PS. To reply to the above participant: the E value of each HSP can be seen on the little white box above the colour codes but first you need to mouse over the desired sequence. The last hit is exactly what the words say : last as in the furthest down of the lines and hit (well if you can't see it then its not thereâ¦pun pun).Or you can click on the coloured bar and it will take you to the alignment. 
I did, I think you have confused the last hit value- the results need to be sorted according to E-value I think, so you get all the zeros together at first and then the other values, just hit on e-value column header just as in excel. #MATH. The answer for the quiz though is the same as zero is still the closest to whatever -174. Cheers.

Arleigh, Since you seem to have been stuck at the same place I was, perhaps you can post in detail how you got unstuck.  Specifically: 1) where did you find the sequences we are suppose to use.  I can't find anything saying ""you will need these sequences for the lab"" and asking you to right click.  ...where is this? 2) I have downloaded Mega 6 and Crimson Editor to my Windows 7 machine..both appear to be functional.  Once I get the sequence from the location do I just copy it and paste it into the crimson editor?  once I get the output from crimson do I save it to my computer as a word document and let mega6 find it as a file?

70,Medieval time warming & geologic & historical time sea level rise -- what do models say?,globalwarming-002,1,resolves,"Not sure where this question goes.

In wk 7 we are doing a homework of short vs long term sea level change and lectures on ice sheet melting and sea level rise. So, the question 4,5 in the short vs long term sea level change assignment gave a formula for geologic time sea level rise per change in temperature. The q4 is a significant value and the medieval time warming is likewise a significt degree C change. So the natural question is --- Has there been and is there continuing to be a sea level rise from the medieval time warming??

77,Feedback Q5: Model the Lapse Rate and Greenhouse Effect,globalwarming-002,1,resolves,"As I see it, while water vapor is a greenhouse gas, it doesn't have the same effect as CO2. I answered the questions and got a 4/5, missing Q5. That means that I don't understand what Q3 and Q4 are actually telling me with regards to feedback. As Q5 states as definition: ""A positive feedback is a consequence of global warming that leads to further warming, and a negative feedback is a consequence of global warming that lessens the amount of warming."" I tested using the model, leaving CO2 at 0, and changing the Lapse Rate from 0 to 5 K/km #MATH and got the following emission to space values: LR = 0 K/m^2: 227 W/m^2 LR = 5 K/km: 219 W/m^2 LR = 10 K/km: 223 W/m^2 This shows that water is indeed a GHG as the radiation is greater with a dry atmosphere than moist, less power is radiated. So, I then reset the model and checked the effect at the same LR steps but with set CO2 as follows: LR = 0 K/m^2, CO2 = 279 ppm: 227 W/m^2 LR = 5 K/m^2, CO2 = 279 ppm: 200 W/m^2 LR = 10 K/m^2, CO2 = 279 ppm: 191 W/m^2 To me, this indicates that while water vapor is a GHG, it's presense reduces the effect of CO2, the dry adiabat emissions are less than the moist's. That indicates to me that the feedback of the moist LR is negative, and as the LR at 5 is stated to be due to it being a moist adiabat, then the feedback of water vapor must also be negative by default. But as my answer to that effect was indicated as wrong, I'm bamboozled. As there was no check leaving CO2 at 0 ppm and changing LR as I did I feel that I am missing something obvious in teh lesson that the exercise is supposed to teach me. Can anyone provide a link to further explain this in context of climatology?",,1,0

To me, this implies that Venus was not provided as much water as earth in the early stages of planetary development, or if it was, such as from comets, then something overrode the effects of water vapor.

I assumed that ""equilibrium"" means that the radiated power into space is brought back to the value found prior to increasing CO2, for Q3, and decreasing LR, in Q4, as I got the answers correct. What is meant by ""equilibrium"" in this context? It seems that the greenhouse gases will still store energy throughout the system so I am confused as to what the values we find in these questions mean.

80,GHGs in lower atmosphere - are they harmless?,globalwarming-002,1,elaborates,"In the layer model, greenhouse gases near ground level correspond to panes of glass near ground level, and their impact on surface temperature is to impede the flow of heat upward. However, if I understand the lectures of week 2 properly, heat flows freely upward by convection to the height of the tropopause, and the radiation absorption properties of the lower atmosphere has no impact on the temperature profile and heat flow up to that level. So, it would seem, only CO2 near or above the skin layer is effective in raising the altitude and depressing the temperature of the skin. For CO2, this doesn't matter so much, because the CO2 concentration will be constant with altitude. But water (because it has condensed out) and methane (because it is destroyed by stratospheric OH, O, and O3) will have lower concentrations at high altitude than near the surface. So, it would seem, they are less effective as GHGs than might be thought at first from lab measurements. Is this analysis correct?
The GHGs near the surface radiate downwards and add to the surface energy budget. In the MODTRAN online model, you can test the effect of varying the GHG values by first setting the altitude to 0km and switch from ""looking down"" to ""looking up"". In the tropical setting the downward radiation is 348.23 W/M2 at 400ppm CO2 and 350.11 at 800Oppm CO2. Try it for different settings, it has a definite effect, so it is not ""harmless"".",,2,0

But the lectures did not explain what physical or chemical difference in the atmosphere causes this change. Is it that this is the level above which the atmosphere is heated by uv?

In the simple glass plate model the assumption is made that the plate can radiate energy to the ground even though it is at a lower temperature than the ground. You can find no end of claims on various blogsites that this is a violation of the laws of thermodynamics or whatever. Of course there is no violation of any law of thermodynamics, nevertheless the lecture simply assumes without further comment that you can indeed have radiation from a cold to a warmer body, and it might be helpful to have some explanation as to why the skeptics are wrong. 
It is actually pretty hilarious what crazy ideas about physics some of the extreme ""skeptics"" have.

93,pulling wagon to top of ramp takes 4 steps not 3,howthingswork1-002,1,resolves,"You could argue 2 steps are sufficient to get the wagon to the top of the ramp, accelerate from a stop at the bottom of the hill then inertial movement requiring equal force to the downhill ramp force until you reach the top. Once you get to the top if you want to stop the wagon it will take 2 more steps: decrease the force allowing the wagon to accelerate in a downhill direction until it stops, then reapply equal force to maintain the wagon in an inertial velocity of zero, otherwise your wagon will roll right back down the hill. I would understand 2 steps or 4 steps better than 3 steps to get to the top. You either want to reach it, or get there and stay there.
I have a question on Ramps part 4, the work it takes to move the wagon up and down a hill. Is it fair to say that you are also doing work on your body, putting energy into moving your body up the hill, which is also stored as gravitational potential energy? But going up the hill you put work into moving both you and the wagon, while going downhill the gravitational potential energy is supplying the energy for the work to move both you and the wagon down the hill? So up the hill uses your energy and down the hill uses the stored gravitational potential energy. I don't understand quite how the energy is transferred from the wagon to the person going down hill. Maybe if I pretend I am a rubber band and lowering the wagon down the hill so the wagon's potential energy is transferring to me, decreasing the wagon's potential energy until it is zero while increasing he rubber-band's potential energy to spring back. But as humans we can't store the energy transfer, it just makes us hotter. Would that be correct -ish?",,2,0
94,Why upward acceleration(as soon as the ball is thrown up) isn't considered? Falling balls - Part5,howthingswork1-002,1,resolves,"As I understand it, when the Professor throws the ball up, he applies a force on the ball. Since a force is being applied on the ball, it is accelerated up and the ball gets an initial velocity. My question is, why isn't acceleration due to the force applied by the Prof (i.e. acceleration in the upward direction) being considered or mentioned?  Hope I'm clear.
Acceleration = velocity increases in the direction you're going. Deceleration = velocity decreases in the direction you're going (slowing down as you run up the stairs, remember?). Therefore, the upward movement of the ball (due to the exertion of force on it) is NOT acceleration but deceleration.   (You might find skating part 4 helpful). 
And I'd like to add to what I wrote earlier: You wrote: "" Since a force is being applied on the ball, it is accelerated up and the ball gets an initial velocity"" and that's not the way I understood the order of things #MATH
 You wrote ""Acceleration of an object depends on the Force experienced by the object and its mass"" but actually, it depends on the net force and mass. And don't forget that in addition to the force you exert on an object- no matter in what direction- gravity (another force, that is) is exerted on it as well. Not to mention other forces we ignore for now, such as air resistance. 
Acceleration due to the force applied by the professor isn't mentioned because we study the motion of the ball from the time it leaves professor's hand. At this time, the force that professor was applying does not exist anymore therefore it does not influence the ball's motion.
Yes, this makes a lot of sense.. The point from which we undertake the study of the ball's velocity and acceleration etc. might explain it. I saw in another thread where something about the impulse/momentum transferred were mentioned while discussing the ball's motion. I still would like to hear more on this question.

Does that mean that weight of the wagon is the same as support force of the ramp (sidewalk) on the wagon? Otherwise the net force would not be zero and the wagon should be moving.

98,How A Bicycle Really Moves?,howthingswork1-002,"1,3,5.",elaborates,"The derivation of how static friction is used to pull wheeled vehicles forward really blew my mind. I have a question below: Cycling the pedal turns the back wheel, also known as the power wheel. Assuming no-slip conditions, static friction on the ground pulls the back wheel, and thereby the whole bicycle, ahead. However, the front wheel experiences static friction that pulls it backwards. So, for there to be forward motion, the static friction at the back wheel must be larger than that at the front wheel?
Yes, I believe the static friction on the back wheel is larger than on the front wheel, because of the torque on the back wheel by your work on the pedal. I hope I say this correctly. 
 I think front and rear wheel experience almost the same static friction on the ground because they are under same condition (same material, roughness....) and exert half of the weigh to the ground (assume the CG is almost at the center between the two wheels.) As considering a slipping condition, a highly rotated rear wheel exerts a small friction on ground and makes the bicycle accelerates a little bit. As the same time, (same?) friction is exerted by the ground on front wheel and causes it rotates. what makes bicycle slow down is friction toque by wheel bearing and ground (e.g protrusion, sticking.....) 
I think the rear wheel must experience stronger friction than the front. How else will there be a horizontal force propelling the bicycle forward?
 The friction force from the ground on the front wheel ( a free wheel) only needs to be enough to give a torque to turn the wheel. This is not much of a force as can be demonstrated by lifting the wheel off the ground and turning it by hand. However, the force required to accelerate the cycle (and cyclist) forwards is much bigger, try pushing a cyclist who is not pedalling. This bigger force is the one exerted as static friction on the rear wheel. It needs to be big enough to accelerate the cycle plus cyclist, and overcome the friction on the front wheel. Cheers, Ken.

101,Is thermal energy usually wasted energy?,howthingswork1-002,"1,3.",elaborates,"Dr.Blomfield states in the lectures on sliding friction that generally thermal energy is a wasted form of energy. Though I understand his explanation about it being disordered, I still can't assure myself that more often than not thermal energy can't be used for doing work. What about when we cook our food in a cooking pan? Can't we say that the thermal energy is doing useful work there? 
I believe he said, that is it usually a wasted form of energy. I took it to mean in a human, he was using himself as an example, thermal energy is usually a wasted form of energy. Since volcano, fire, and boiling water is also thermal energy. I can also think of other wastes of thermal energy, the heat a computer puts off, and the same in your car, (assuming you don't live where it is freezing, than you need it). I hope this helps. Happy Learning. 
Hi, Yes, usually thermal energy can't be directly used in humans. But I guess I am a bit confused about what work means in the context of thermal energy. For example if thermal energy helps keep us warm (I am currently staying in a place where it snows) can we say that thermal energy has been put to use? 
Hi Prashanth, Thermal energy is usually (not always) considered as a  wasted form of energy in physics because we cannot ""recover"" it. In regard to the cooking of food, once the food is cooked, the thermal energy that is used to cook the food can no longer be recovered. It is also from the second law of thermodynamics that we cannot harness all the thermal energy for useful work. Cheers, ChinChai 
Hi, Cooked food has more energy than raw food. Check this out: #URLREF#URLREF-calorie-counts-are-wrong-cooked-food-provides-... So I guess when we cook, some of the thermal energy is being converted to some other form of energy (maybe chemical energy)? Again, the same question that I asked above, what defines whether thermal energy is being recovered or not? For example when we use heat to keep our body warm, aren't we kind of using the thermal energy?

105,Falling Balls Part 3: Earth lb versus Moon lb,howthingswork1-002,"1,2.",elaborates,"We were told a lb on the Moon is less than a lb on Earth. Wouldn't the measures be relative to the place we are weighing? Would there be a earth lb to moon lb conversion factor? That would mean we would need a local reference for the weight stated on a package - per the example (1 Earth lb or 1 Moon lb.)
The gravitational force on earth is about 6 times more than that on the moon. So I would think that a lb on Moon is about 6 times less than that on Earth. As we have heard in lectures, the gravitational acceleration is not exactly same on all parts of the earth, and I would expect the same on the moon too.  But for most of the common purposes the gravitational acceleration can be considered constant. So I would say 1 Earth lb = 6 Moon lb. As for the statement on the package, a lb is not universal. Stating the mass (kg) on the packet would be a better way.
On earth a kg has weight 2.2 pounds force. Louis B is saying that on the moon a kg has weight of 2.2 / 6 pounds force. The relativity problem would come in if we weighed with weights on a scale. If we used a spring scale, for example, it wouldn't come in.",,3,0

The weight is really the force that pulls the object to the surface of the earth. That force on the object gets greater and greater as we go up. That's why, if you drop your laptop from the top of a huge building, the laptop will suffer more damage than when you drop it 1 or 2 meters above the ground; there is a greater force acting on the laptop when it's higher above the ground. That force= weight . The mass is really just the kilogram or pounds of the object.

Is ""Breaking the waves"" by Lars von Trier a marriage movie? I think so, because the story wouldn't be the same, if the protagonists were not married.
Hi Anna, I think ""Breaking the Waves"" is a very interesting movie and that it ""qualifies"" as a marriage movie, yes, even if it is a really crazy one! Iâm not sure if anyone brought up this film to the discussion already but I think âBefore Midnightâ (2013) is the perfect example of a marriage movie in recent years. Not just because it is the case that the movie wouldnât function in any way without the central couple but also because it resolves one of the problems Jeanine talked about in one of the first lectures: the problem of a marriage being a subject that takes a long period of time to develop. As you know, âBefore Midnightâ is the third movie of the Linklater trilogy about the relationship of Jesse and Celine â being the first one, âBefore Sunriseâ (1995), about falling in love, the second one, âBofore Sunsetâ (2004), about the reencounter, and, finally, âBefore Midnightâ, specially focused on the aspects of a long-term relationship. I just love this film and think that the director made an excellent and subtle job showing what changes and what the challenges are for people when they decide to stay together. 
Brief Encounters is a film that will be discussed in the 3rd week. It is an excellent film story by Noel Coward. What I like about it is that it involves emotional infidelity but not in the usual way films have it. I.e., with the married person having a spouse who is insufferable or an idiot. That is such an easy rationalization for stepping outside the marriage. But in Brief Encounters, the spouse being left at home is simply not the same as the other guy and so the woman develops a strong desire for a different person. Well at least that makes for a more complicated and perhaps realisitic story to tell and Coward's screenplay handles it extremely well. 
When Anthony said ""Brief Encounters"" I thought ""Close Encounters (of the Third Kind)"", and it made perfect sense to me. It took me a while to realyse the misunderstanding. I didn't see the movie ""Brief Encounter"" yet but now I'm very curious about it. At first it seemed very difficult to think of a ""marriage film"" but know they keep popping up in my mind. Thinking about ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (a film I really don't like), at the surface it seems like a sci-fi movie but it's actually about a guy that feels bored with he's family and wants to experience something knew, to encounter someone who shares his point of view. Not the aliens! but the other woman with whom he feels useful and at home. Does it sound too far-fetched?
 Does Gaspar Noe's 'Irreversible' count as a marriage movie? If it does, it must be one of the most disturbing ones ever. It's interesting that the two main actors in it, Vincent Cassell and Monica Bellucci, are married in real life too. 
My example of a Marriage Movie would be ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" with Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie. It does have excitement, true, but the marriage is what makes the movie. If the characters were not married then it would be any other cookie-cutter action movie.
 I would class the 1968 film 'The Lion in Winter' as largely a marriage movie. Although its context is the politics of Henry II's 12th century court and especially those of his bickering family, at the very centre of the film is the turbulent marriage of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, as played out in all its drama and comedy during a Christmas court. These central characters have been married long and we learn of their many traumas and battles with each other over the years, which still continue, and yet somehow they remain oddly a couple who have genuine affection for each other. Although this is a historical and royal setting, there are elements in this marriage which must surely resonate with contemporary audiences.",,9,0

 I watched a French film last night titled ""La Doublure"" (in English "" the Valet.). My husband thought it was a marriage movie and I was looking for the 7 problem areas. The problems were infidelity and money (too much and too little), but it was not really a marriage movie at all. It did have 2 marriages in it, but neither was the central theme. 
 We have watched another French film that's a perfect example of a marriage movie where the situation exacerbates the differences in the couple. The movie is ""The Women on the 6th Floor."" The husband is a quiet, non- expressive man and his wife is uptight and neurotic. There's clearly no joy in this long term marriage, just boredom. This all changes when a group of ""sassy Spanish maids"" move into the couple's building 2 stories up. The husband is curious about these women and their zest for life and he is slowly drawn into their world as a great friend. The wife doesn't understand the situation at all and, I think, just thinks her boring husband has lost his mind. He's having the time of his life and finding real joy.

114,Suspicion: The Controversial Ending.,marriageandmovies-001,1,resolves,"Mrs Basinger alluded to the ending of ""Suspicion"", and how it tends to provoke strong responses. What do you think....Was Johnnie intending homicide or suicide? I always struggle with the ending of this movie- Either way, it seems to me, at the very least, Lina should have some serious doubts about the future of the relationship. Her assertion they will ""See it all through"" seems so odd given how tumultuous the film presents. But it is Cary Grant after all. That face could cover a multitude of sins. ;) Another aside - A couple of years ago I found this link to the original ending. It's fun to remember that sometimes the film's final product isn't the original perspective. Would love to hear what you think of this alternative: #URLREF~muffin/suspicion_c..html 
The last few minutes of the film are gripping. Both endings show Hitchcock messing with us. I love it! I am reminded of when, as an American student in Paris in the late 1960s, I came out of a French film with some French classmates and expressed my consternation that the ending was unresolved. ""But what happens next?"" I whined. The shocking, chuckled response: ""Nothing, of course. The film is over.""
My first impression is homicide because that would be in line with the story and his character. I think Hitchcock did his job well and left us to choose....if you're hopelessly in love and positive you will choose suicide. I can't imagine why the woman stayed with Johny. She had so many reasons to doubt him and distrust him, and still, she's staying. He staged everything well. They return home, he gained trust with her and she's going to fall into his trap. Great suspence.
This is one of many Hitchcock masterpieces--If I were her I would have left--alternatively; she is so relieved that she forgives all and discounts her previous doubts and stays to make a go of the marriage. Regardless of how you feel it is a good entertaining film. 
The IMDb states in its Trivia on ""Suspicion"" : "" Alfred Hitchcock originally wanted Johnnie to be guilty, but the studio insisted that the public wouldn't accept Cary Grant as a murderer. Hitchcock's original ending had Johnny killing Lina by poisoning her milk, but then convicting himself by mailing a letter that Lina had written. Joan Fontaine said, Cary Grant ""did kill me in the original cut, but at a preview, the audience simply refused to accept him as the murderer."" 
Did Hitchcock do his walk-on in this movie? If he did, I didn't recognize him. The ending left me suspicious. I believe he really intended to kill her, but decided to wait for a more opportune time. Cary Grant was a very romantic and lovable scoundrel. Monkey-face was afraid of the dreaded ""spinster"" word, or worse yet ""old maid"" stigma for women of that time. She married the first man who asked her, and what a debonnaire and diabolical catch he was. Her paranoia from the first meeting was justified.

 Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) Bridges of Madison County (1999) Hope Springs (2012) I think these are beautiful examples of the trials and tribulations of marriage and of the impecable performance of Merryl Streep. 
What about the movie ""Revolutionary Road(2008)"" directed by Sam Mendes? It seems about the essence of life in which marriage is inevitable and plays an important role. 
I was thinking of Zhang Yimou ""To live"" (1994). A wonderful story of a couple who manages to remain together and raise a family, ""to live,"" through very dramatic times. Another example is "" The best intentions"" by Bille August, script by Ingmar Bergman, in which it is told the story of the marriage of the parents of Bergman.

120,Gaslight: Marriage movie or not?,marriageandmovies-001,1,elaborates,"I was watching the fifth lecture, and when Professor Basinger asked for us to try to figure out which movies were marriage movies and which weren't, the first film that popped into my head was Gaslight (1944), with Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Angela Lansbury and Joseph Cotten. So I started thinking about it. It's certainly not strictly a marriage movie, more like film noir, but I was thinking about Professor Basinger's question as to whether the plot hinged on the characters being married or not. I think in this case, it absolutely does. In what other situation besides marriage could Charles Boyer have exercised that kind of power over Ingrid Bergman (unless he was another member of her family, a father or a brother)? The two of them have to live in the same house and she has to trust him enough to do what he wants and believe what he says. I don't think the film would be as suspenseful as it is if they were merely two people living together, even if he did know about her aunt's murder and carried out all the same actions. The fact that he is her husband makes the events of the film more potent and horrifying--it makes it even harder for her to get away, and because he's her husband it doesn't occur to her that he is the instigator, so she blames her own mind.

Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan : they are not married but they are becoming a romantic couple who breathes marriage, made for each other. Movies: - You've got mail - Sleepless in Seattle 
Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are definitely a modern day movie couple in the classical sense, although they have not worked together of late. Some movie couples from yesteryear might include: Hepburn and Tracy Rogers and Astaire Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland William Powell and Myrna Loy (even beyond the Thin Man movies) 
 I enjoy Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan together. They both are sweet & ""have goodness"" in them. I wonder if there are any movies made, from 1940s to present that show how couples handle the doldrums of marriage? The woman busy with cooking, cleaning, & raising children, husband busy with career & how they put the magic back into their marriage as the boredom sets & they realize what they will be losing??? 
 From TV how about Rob and Laura Petrie from the Dick Van Dyke show? Or even earlier Margaret and Jim Anderson from Father Knows Best? I thought both these couples were very realistic in the way they related to each other.

The African Queen. They are not married, although very much like a marriage.
I'm not sure I would classify The African Queen as a marriage movie. Yes Kate and Bogie bicker and fight and eventually reach a happy ending, but I think this is a romantic film with a subplot of war that leads to their marriage near the end of the movie.

127,BioPics as marriage movies?,marriageandmovies-001,1,social," Many biographical films about a famous man or woman would probably qualify as marriage movies, since the marriage partner, and so the marriage, often plays a central role in the success of the lead character. For example, Coal Miner's Daughter wouldn't have been made without Mooney Lynn's (Tommy Lee Jones in the movie) role in making his wife Loretta Lynn's career. The Johnny Cash bio pic Walk the Line probably wouldn't have been made without June Carter Cash. Even the Iron Lady needed Dennis Thatcher. 
Good point. Actually Walk the Line was released in Brazil with the title ""Johnny and June"", focusing on the couple.
this is a good point, and a reason why defining the ""Marriage Movie"" is so complicated. Marriage being such a powerful social construct means that the BioPic is most often going to deal in some way with Marriage or Marriages in the case of Johnny, I keep thinking of something like Giant, where the marriage is not the cause of the drama but it is the constant and over lying theme.

131,The Rolling Stones Andy Warhol Zippers and Sticky Fingers,warhol-001,1,social,"The 1970s witnessed a flood of open sexuality - post-Stonewall riot, birth of disco, Transcendental Meditation and Swinger's clubs are all coming signs of the sexual revolution. Sex, or rather, the more open attitude about it was everywhere. Warhol, a quiet, conservative Catholic homosexual must have had a sigh of relief - after having fully recovered from an assassination attempt (by Valerie Solanas) he surrounded himself with me and began to feverishly create works that walks the line between art and pornography. When asked to create the cover and concept for the Rolling Stones' ""Sticky Fingers"" album Warhol was quick to capitalize on the sexual allure of lead singer Mick Jagger (The image is NOT of Jagger by the way) and Warhol's casual remark to Jagger that it would be interesting to have an album cover with a zipper on it. When you undid the belt buckle, white cotton underwear stamped with Andy Warhol was revealed (it also served to protect the vinyl from the real metal zipper). Gone is the playful innuendo of a large banana (from the Velvet Underground) finding in this work, Warhol flaunting his voyeuristic sexuality (a male with a rather large penis), his interest in combing art with mass consumption (the album would be one of the Rolling Stones' most successful), along with the continuation of his fascination with provoking the boring. Please upflag this post if you've read it or bought the album! 
This was such great album cover! I remember seeing it on display in a record store at the time, and would've have bought it if I'd had enough money. Unfortunately, the zippers caused serious problems in the distribution process, such as tearing the cellophane wrappers and catching on each other in stacks. Andy must have conceived this as an artwork on the wall, and not packed into cartons sitting on forklifts. 
Alice Thanks for reading and replying to my post (maybe give it an up flag?) I worked for years at a record store and saw hundreds of this album fly out the door. It was too bad that later reissues did away with the real zipper and cloth undies ...
Warhol did a quite few album covers including Love you live.According to: #URLREF#URLREF-post-6-musicgraphics/ RCA Records hired Warhol, along with another freelance artist, Sid Maurer, to design album covers and promotional materials. I wonder who Mick is biting and why. The hand looks feminine. However, given their relationship, it might be Keith. Yes, I know, there is no skull ring or have I the wrong hand. The count Basie is a little tamer and nothing risque about Hugo Winterhalter album. Both I think would be early work. 
Darryl: Thanks for commenting on my thread and it shows how quick corporate America is quick to capitaliz on the usccessful. The Gershwin cover comes from a drawing Warhol did in the 50s - probably reflecting the age of the music. If I saw the Basie out of context, I might even be hard pressed to vote it a Warhol cover. As for the Stone - no doubt - and maybe the hand is the hand that feed you. :-)

132,Porn as art ?,warhol-001,1,requests,"It seems to me that Warhol is treating pornography in the same way, essentially, as he treated Campbell's Soup, in that he's taken something that already existed commercially ( even if ""underground"") and made it into art by putting the Warhol stamp on it. ""Blow Job"" is, I think, interesting as it's not unlike the product of the underground porn studios of the time who tended to offer more than they delivered in terms of content. The same is true of ""Hollywood"". I remember the posters for the film ""Barbarella"" prominently stating that ""She strips in space"" ( I've no idea if she did or not, I've never seen it but I'm confident that it wouldn't have been the ""full monty"".). 
Barbarella never stripped (in film ) . Guess Warhol took what was a common way of thinking and turned it upside down . His movies are hard to find i guess .
Oh yes she did! She was played by Jane Fonda. It was in the opening sequence of the movie. You must have seen a censored version.
 Perhaps, as a devout Catholic he was challenging his own religious beliefs. #URLREF 
Pornography is defined as writing or images designed to stimulate sexual excitement. It's constantly around us as entertainment. I'm watching Game of Thrones and that's a lot more graphic any any couch Andy had. The slippery slope of course is when there is lack of consent, or harm is being done. 
I've been thinking about this ( probably not good for me !) and it seems to me that , historically, there was no shortage of ""pornography"" in art, including plenty of homo-erotic depictions , from Ancient Greek and Roman vases and paintings through prints from Japan and China and ""secret works"" by Rowlandson etc and Aubrey Beardsley etc. So what was different here ? Is it the media that Warhol was using, is a ""pornographic"" photo somehow more ""pornographic"" than a lithograph ?

Perhaps viewing the world as an ""outsider"" provided a very distinct viewpoint. Being different and open about it (also his dress, appearance) takes away inhibitions - removes the risk because he's already an outsider. It's not just how he reconciled his sexuality to religion, but how he reconciled his sexuality to life, America, culture, publicity.... As someone has mentioned: ""I don't see why his sexuality should matter"". Perhaps, in America in the 1960's - it really does matter. Was the art influence by his sexuality, and/or was his open living influenced by his art?
 Great point! I think his open living was influenced by his art. 
I think his sexuality is refleccted in his art. In his art but also in his appearence, as you said. Sexuality is something about yourself, is part of you. Without it, you may see things different. That is why I think that yes, what we see in his works is his identity. 
 As a lifelong follower of Andy Warhol, I am slightly ashamed to admit that I had forgotten the very homoerotic nature of Warhol's initial forays and failures into the world of ""fine art"" throughout the 1950s. The following is a touching and at times chilling profile of Andy Warhol that relies upon source material rather that conjecture and speculation... #URLREF 
One can easily speculate Warhol's once overt homoerotic content became ubiquitous and subvert as and after he attained the recognition and notoriety he claimed to desire.
Andy Warhol is very important for the queer culture. Considering his first films about the homoerotic content, we can say his one of the first film makers at this kind at his era. His homosexuality is liquid to all his work, point of view, full of symbolism and allegory. In this way, I believe that his homosexuality was something like an idea for him. 
I am sort of offended by the term queer for people who are gay. 
I always thought of Warhol as presenting an asexuality. I assumed that it was probably a pose and/or a way of keeping people guessing to increase the mystery and thereby the 'superstardom'. 
The first works that Warhol submitted to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay.The fact that Warhol's homosexuality influenced his work and shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship on the artist and is an issue that Warhol himself addressed in interviews, in conversation with his contemporaries, and in his publications.Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes.

I wonder how different his art would've been if he had taken a different path in his personal life and allowed himself to be openly gay? Perhaps the art would've come back to the same juncture of pop art because in the end he cared most about money and therefore needed to find a way to make art that allowed for that.

I find it very fascinating that he was so openly gay during a time when it was not at all accepted as is it today. Besides being a great artist, he was a strong man to be able to stand up and admit he was homosexual during a time when society did not recognize it.

That book (great title!) is amazing and warholian in the sense that is all very contradictory: logical in its illogical premises, shallow and, because of that, full of deep insights, playful and serious.

Bob Colacello was Andy Warhol's social collaborator, photographer, and travel companion, as well as editor of Warhol's Interview magazine for twelve years between 1970 and 1982.

In both cases, a certain naivete about the possibility of collective cooperation was permanently lost. Andy's near-death experience made him, once again, a mirror of his culture, but this time in a most unwelcome way. 
Yes, and Andy took it further by making an artwork of a gun like the one that nearly killed him. I don't think many victims of violence would create an artwork based on their personal experience.

139,How much is it worth?,warhol-001,1,elaborates,"Prices in the world of art are soaring to historical highs - despite the grim reality of most economic forecasts? What factors do you think contribute to these high costs - is it really ""about the art"" or something else? Do you suspect that Warhol wanted everyone to be able to afford art? 
We all know that Jackson Pollock used house paint to create many of the paintings that now costs hundreds of millions. Part of the price tag goes to the fact that Pollock is such an iconic figure - similar to James Dean (living hard and dying young) Pollock represents the kind of future America was hoping for. If Pollock represents the new Post-WWII American, perhaps Warhol is the proto-teenager who is celebrity worshiping, interested in sex and sexuality, and though smart - is willing to play on the line. These kinds of ""stories"" that get attached to artists will drive up the cost of the work 
I think the ""grim reality of most economic forecasts"" refers to the increasing (and in my view, obscene) increase in economic stratification. But, the soaring prices of art may be attributable to that same stratification. The economic forecasts for the 0.1% aren't grim at all. They're doing very well, and one imagines that they're the ones paying millions for art. The 99%, many of whom are unemployed, many of whom are just scraping by, aren't the ones setting records at Sotheby's.
I do think it is about something else--status and bragging rights. My opinion is cynical, but do these collectors visit their local museums, and not just the temporary touring exhibitions? Do they appreciate the art they hang on their walls? And no, I don't think Andy wanted anyone who could not pay a price to have his works. Would he have taken a commission to paint an anonymous individual if that person did not have a bag full of green notes?
I believe it also has a lot to do with networking - who you know, as well as being able to sell yourself (as well as your art). I don't think this is necessarily new, but with the advent of TV and now the Internet and Social Media, we can all witness the life of those 'touched by fame'. Of course, the artistic urge to create and express needs to come from the individual, but that initial impulse alone is not enough to succeed. Art is a commodity, and so is the artist, and that needs to be established to feed the market. Something Warhol did to perfection. 
Art is an investment, sort of like gold. The price paid for an art piece doesn't necessarily mean the buyer even likes the piece of art, just that it has huge monetary value, which will increase with time. In a way the poor economic situation is more of a factor that speeds up the increase of the value of art instead of slowing it down. When the value of money is going down, it might be smart to invest your money on something that's value is going up and sell again when the economic situation is better. 
Iikka: I couldn't agree with you more - indeed, for the ""rich"" these works are nothing more than another item in their investment portfolio. They often don't even display them #MATH. 
And isn't this quote from the readings this week interesting: I like money on the wall. Say you were going to buy a $200,000 painting. I think you should take that money, tie it up, and hang it on the wall. Then when someone visited you the first thing they would see is the money on the wall. 
Yes, that is a great comment on the art market and art values in modern times by Warhol. 
I think Warhol saw money as a status symbol, and he saw being sharp in business as a status symbol... perhaps it came out of the times or his background, such as a childhood during the Great Depression. I think he had a soft spot for the early 20th century ideas of business, going so far as to name his ""Factory"" analogous to a business owner in industry. 
 Incidentally, having lived through the Great Depression may also be the origin of some of his hoarding behavior. It's pretty common for people who've lived through a period of scarcity like that to have some residual anxiety about their survival that can manifest as hoarding. 

It's obvious that Warhol was afraid of poverty. I doubt that he imagined one of his works selling for more than $100 milliion dollars recently. That might be heaven for him.
Kathleen - one of the drawbacks of this kind of Discussion is I really have no idea of the people or background anyone may have. If you have experienced poverty then I am certain you have a different perspective than I have. I am petrified of poverty - and work hard every day to make sure my circumstances are okay - but I also realize that my working hard and ""lucky circumstances"" are always in my control. So, I do apologize if I came across inappropriately.
Not all collectors are simply investing in art for a return. I went to school with the Schulhofs. The family was very successful in business. Tommy was in my graduating class and Mickey became vice chairman of Sony America. The family's fine art printing business was very successful in its own right. Their mother was the art lover who did not work in business. Her collection of post WWII art that she bought from artists that she got to know primarily in NY and Europe grew and became very valuable, perhaps worth more than several hundred million dollars. The bulk of her collection went to the Guggenheim in Venice recently because she had befriended Peggy Guggenheim. When she was alive, her collection hung in her house. Less than a sixth of the collection went to her heirs. Most went to the Guggenheim in Venice that once was Peggy Guggenheim's house. There may have been tax benefits to making the gift, and perhaps her children and grandchildren didn't need any more money. But if she didn't love the art and artists she collected, why would she have spent 40 years collecting and finally donating it to a museum?

Thanks for posting to this thread Kent - in fact, you'll find that the Schulhof's are currently in the news - being sued for not complying with the last wishes of Peggy Guggenheim. But, that's not why I am replying. Not everyone collects for investment - I am thinking her of Herb and Dorothy Vogel. They were able to amass a fantastic collection while earning no more that $23,000 a year. When they passed, they donating 50 pieces of their collection to each of the 50 states (again earning them a mark in my book). So, money isn't everything and as they say, you can never have enough money. But, I'd sure like to find that out for myself one day ...
Paul, the Schulhof's are not being sued directly. Some of the Guggenheim heirs are suing the Guggenheim Foundation over the way they are managing the Guggenheim Collection in Venice. Mickey Schulhof is on the board, and some of the Guggenheims are not happy with what the board is doing. It is wise to remember that the Guggenheims were not exactly poor, and that Peggy Guggenheim was an heiress that was best known for collecting modern art and sleeping with lots and lots of artists. She was not an artist herself, nor were the Schulhofs. I knew Mickey Schulhof in the eighties when I worked in strategic planning at Sony and he was vice chairman. I worked on special projects for him and was his passenger in the corporate jet a half-dozen times when he piloted the plane and we were on special projects. I would much rather have him managing a collection, foundation, or endowment worth hundreds of millions of dollars or more than the eccentric Guggenheim plaintiffs. And so would Andy Warhol, the businessman/artist, I would guess.

Kathleen - there was a time when I scraped the bottom - but whether I understand it the way you do, is unlikely. Of course I could say something like it gets better or something like that - but that wouldn't be the right thing to say either. I hope things change for you in a way that you hope.

I agree that the staggeringly large amounts that pieces are going for are motivated by investments as well as bragging right and status. And I would LOVE to know what Warhol would think of his work going for so much. Undoubtedly he'd be thrilled, but I wonder how else he would feel and what else he would think, if anything.
Desiree - when I read your comment I heard Warhol say #MATH Thanks for posting on this thread. 
 Interesting posts. Warhol's work is now being sold for hundreds of thousands ( and millions) of dollars. And yet, he ""stole"" images from random sources, and at times had others complete works he signed. Art is a very strange world!! Prices for art is even stranger!! If I read correctly, Warhol had fallen from favor in the art world in the years before he died. He would I'm sure, be thrilled with his rebirth as a star. 
I think he would be absolutely thrilled, even if for only 15 minutes...
Warhol's astounding success puts him in the arena with such genii as Picasso and Van Gogh, and he cannot be ignored as a genius in his art to capture strongly the concepts of American culture, both in his day, and, prophetically, today. Norman Rockwell captured an America we all loved; but it no longer exists in the eyes of the world. It still exists in many American hearts, though.
It was interesting hearing Mr d'Offay in the Week 2 video #MATH evoke strong emotional ties to the relevant social and political issues of today, as if Warhol had the uncanny ability not only to see the world as it was in the mid to late 20th century, but also to accurately predict what it would be like half a century later. Fascinating...
Artist's have always painted for money but they have not been quite as explicit as Andy Warhol. He seems to have been the first person to create a business out of art. Art has always been used by people as an investment. Some of these investors end up loosing out as the particular artist ,they were advised to invest in , falls out of fashion but some have grown to really appreciate art.
Anonymous - sorry, but I will disagree with you here. Most of our successful artists painted for money and HAVE been as explicit as Warhol. Whether it is Michelangelo, Caravaggio or Matisse painting for the church, or Rembrandy and Vermeer painting for the rising middle class - painters have always been interested in plying their goods for money. There is however and important distinction that happens in the mid 1800s. In the Medieval/Renaissance period, artists were simply craftsmen. People like Ghiberti, Micehlangelo and da Vinci are simply people who are making things that happen to be thought of (today) as artistic. They are providing a service to the wealthy. Only later did the romantic idea of ""artist"" come in to play (artist as we understand it today is quite different)
Supply & demand, location location location...
Art as real estate - yup - I get that!
Giovanni Bernini, 17th century sculptor, painter and architect, made a fortune on his art, particularly from the Catholic Pope and aristocrats of his day in Europe. His work will bring you to tears, inspire and tintillate you. He combined spirituality and sexuality. He could make marble drape like silk, and was particularly expert in facial expression. His sculpture, ""The Ecstacy of Saint Theresa"" is breathtaking. There are many websites devoted to it. He was devoutly Catholic, like Warhol, and loved women (not so sure about Warhol on this). Click here: Berniniâs Portrayal of The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa | Sexuality & Love in the Arts 
In those days, artists were hired like tailors or shoemakers, it was regarded as a craft among others. So the scultptures' or paintings' price was agreed upon mostly before beginning the work... not the other way round, as it is today, when the creator of a painting has to go round and display it in galleries, hoping that someone will buy it. It's a totally different view on art, a art-market, if you will, which hasn't started before the 19th century. 
I think ""worth"" is in the eye of the beholder. I may value a Van Gogh over a Warhol...that is my personal choice. What I feel drawn to and what holds meaning for me alone. Art is subjective and the price we pay for a piece of art whether it be to have because I adore it, or to own it, show and to brag about owning it, is what deems one piece ""worth"" more than another to an individual. 
I completely agree Lisa - beauty #MATH. And unlike Coca-Coal - art is NOT a great equalizer.
Lisa you nail it. 
I wonder what would happen if the world ended and the paintings and other art works became more ""valuable"" as clothing, furniture, and other items to survive....wonder if we could eat them ? 
Hi Madelyn: Thanks for commenting on this thread and you raise an interesting point about art. Is art necessary for our survival - well, yes and no. Certainly we cannot sustain the human body on the materials of art - that is kind of silly. However, what art DOES sustain for us is our very sense of human-ness . Indeed the best artists have always reflected on the times in which they live - telling us our collective stories and marking, in a tangible way, what it really means to be our human selves. A Warhol, a Beethoven, a Shakespeare, or a Pavlova all remind us of our very humanity - and this is why art is so important to our survival.
I think Warhol may wanted everyone to like what he was doing so it would be an overdemand for his work that soared the prices. Somehow it worked. ""Andy Warhol paintings take in more than $100 million at auction"" You can read the whole article, published May 14, 2014, here #URLREF-et-cm-andy-warhol-auction-20140514-#URLREF 
There are ""haves"" because there are ""have nots"". There is famous people because of the people who are not famous. The contrast is what makes fame and fame attracts money. I think Andy Warhol was very sensitive towards his personal value in terms of fame. I recall the anecdote when Warhol tried desperately to get in touch with Truman Capote and was rejected because he was no one... 
I think its interesting that Warhol (and other contempory Artists) work in a time where the Artists are aware of the instant high prices and demand for there works on a consumer level. I guess that this has always been true in the art world to a certain extent, with many of the older Artists working on commissions for wealthy famiies (and the church) for example, but it somehow feels more obvious in modern times. Particularly, when you think about Artists whose works are now regarded in high acclaim (and high expense) but did not receive this kind of recognition in their own lifetimes. Like Van Gogh for example. I wonder how many struggling artists of today, huddled around a 1/2 pint in Hoxton will have there works selling for Millions a hundred years from now. Will any of these 'unknowns' be worth more than a Damien Hirst in the future for example. Food for thought.....
""I'm thinking about Peggy Guggenheim right now - were it not for her incrdible promotional spirit many of the works we call ""great"" probably wouldn't be"" - Good point, these 'great artworks' would not be known to us and many would probably not have been seen by many people at all.
Sometimes I can't but think that nowadays everything about art is about possession, so in last consequence, also about money. For example the cases of restitution of artwork robbed by the Nazis in WWII. Why is there so much fuss about it, why do big museums shiver that it might come out that one or more of the works exhibited might be in their possession illegally? I don't think it's really because of some sense for justice. Hasn't the art market even museums in his grip? The more interesting (ans oftentimes that means, costly) exhibits you can show, the more people will come, the more money will flow back into your coffers.
I think there has always been a status-minededness about collecting art from popular artists in modern times, which is an obsession of Warhol's himself. Warhol wanted fame and status as much as someone today who might buy his work to show it off as a symbol of their success. I suppose, however, that there are many motivations for purchasing art, whether for investment purposes or for the true love of it. If money was no object for me, I'd buy up the originals of the Picasso reproductions currently on my wall -- why not?! I do wonder, though, if recent surges aren't a result of the emergence of rapidly-growing Asian markets and the related desire for status-giving products following China's oppressive cultural revolution, and subsequent search for cultural identity. When I saw your question I immediately thought of Bordeaux wine and the documentary Red Obsession! 
Meagan: Thanks for commenting on this link and I do think you are on to something. IN fact, the more HYPE anything has, the more everyone wants on that bandwagon (like your Red Obsession reference!). Right now it might be the growing Asian Market, but for decades there has also been a very strong Russian market and soon India will be in the game. But, money travels - so, what was once here could, in the very near future, be there. It's life, no?
Speaking about money, Salvador Dali is another good example. He insisted having a pot of hot tar under his Paris hotel room window, lowered a tray of china with a rope into the tar, lifted it up, and said: Another $5000.","I think the ""grim reality of most economic forecasts"" refers to the increasing (and in my view, obscene) increase in economic stratification. But, the soaring prices of art may be attributable to that same stratification. The economic forecasts for the 0.1% aren't grim at all. They're doing very well, and one imagines that they're the ones paying millions for art. The 99%, many of whom are unemployed, many of whom are just scraping by, aren't the ones setting records at Sotheby's.
I believe it also has a lot to do with networking - who you know, as well as being able to sell yourself (as well as your art). I don't think this is necessarily new, but with the advent of TV and now the Internet and Social Media, we can all witness the life of those 'touched by fame'. Of course, the artistic urge to create and express needs to come from the individual, but that initial impulse alone is not enough to succeed. Art is a commodity, and so is the artist, and that needs to be established to feed the market. Something Warhol did to perfection. 
Iikka: I couldn't agree with you more - indeed, for the ""rich"" these works are nothing more than another item in their investment portfolio. They often don't even display them #MATH. 
Yes, that is a great comment on the art market and art values in modern times by Warhol. 
 Incidentally, having lived through the Great Depression may also be the origin of some of his hoarding behavior. It's pretty common for people who've lived through a period of scarcity like that to have some residual anxiety about their survival that can manifest as hoarding. 
Kathleen - one of the drawbacks of this kind of Discussion is I really have no idea of the people or background anyone may have. If you have experienced poverty then I am certain you have a different perspective than I have. I am petrified of poverty - and work hard every day to make sure my circumstances are okay - but I also realize that my working hard and ""lucky circumstances"" are always in my control.

140,Art/Money: Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst,warhol-001,1,requests," I feel as if any discussion of AW's legacy will be incomplete without mentioning Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst #URLREF #URLREF So which one is your favorite? 
Well, Jeff Koons is definitely into the celebrity thing - I never know how seriously to take him. 
 I totally agree, Linda. I think he is phenomenal. 
I personally cannot stand Jeff Koons. Damien Hirst I like, though. 
I like both for different reasons but i'm not all that familiar with their works. I really like Jeff's balloon sculptures, I find them very invigorating, fun and interesting. Damien Hirst sometimes just put question marks in my head, half the time I have no idea what he is trying to convey but that is why I like him. 
 Jeff Koons. 
I prefer Damien Hirst as well; he tackles mortality head on. I like his use of color in the dot and spin paintings. I like the works with the butterflies as well. Jeff Koons' work and process are so derivative, so crass and garish. Some works are technically brilliant, but it's hard for me to find other redeemable qualities in his work.
Damien Hirst in a real game changer in the art world, in the way that Warhol was. I know some people feel that way about Koons as well, but I just can't see it, and I would love someone who thinks Koons has changed the direction of modern art to explain their point of view to me!
I think the real problem isn't about Koons vs Hirst. As with the most part of contemporary art we have to cope with the problem of the infinite repetition. Since Duchamp, contemporary artists develop a good idea and then they repeat it till exhaustion. Duchamp should have stopped with the first ready made, Andy with the first Marilyn.

This path gives up emancipation and has no faith in creativity; it does not claim to right a wrong, since it perceives none; it ignores use value and recognizes only exchange value; it instantiates art not in will but in desire, and a very peculiar one: to be a machine.""

Wrbican seems to me to say that once Warhol worked out themes and styles, other artists in his employ would make the art but Warhol managed them and paid them so it was his art to sell under his own name even if a considerable amount of the creative artistic content would have been theirs. (The 'factory' model with an owner and workers without a claim to recognition for their output?) The commissioned art was said to lead to work that Warhol would not have done unless someone were hiring him (and his factory) to do. (The business model of giving the customer what he wants?)

Displaying these works were to feel important and rich, something that most people want.
 Speaking a bit about the process of repeating Warhol think that the first work I perform this way was interesting for people, and continued performing them. these multiple images were of great importance in his career. He took common objects, to important figures, etc.. These works have drawn attention since. They are known worldwide for up to people who are unfamiliar with the art works.

In the film of Glyn Davis, it was posited that the long films are a way of the artist saying that my time is not your time. I believe this is another way of saying that my art is not your art -- my art is conceptual, your art is Thomas Kinkade. As art became more conceptual, it also became more divorced from the general public.

146,Boredom Repetition and Meaning,warhol-001,1,elaborates,"I think boredom is a theme that can be found throughout Warhol's body of work. It's in the way he uses repetition. There is a point at which the object (the Empire State Building in the film, the electric chair, the can of soup) loses meaning as an object, and that lets you see it, and the art, in different ways. I think it's especially interesting to notice how you relate differently to the work once you've crossed this threshold. 
I think what you describe and definitely Warhol does is similar to Automatic Writing that writers used to do a century ago. To try to connect with your deepest feelings. The work of art should come from the soul and not the mind. The unconscious that Freud describes as the ""id"" that is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends. 
I hadn't thought of automatic writing, but yes, absolutely. I don't think the mind disengages completely with Warhol's repetition. Rather, with the loss of meaning comes new meaning, you see the form rather than the function of the object. 
Yes, you got a good point ther because meaning cannot be constructed without the active participation of the mind. But on the other hand, Warhol said ""I want to be a machine"". There is some confusion to that; Warhol wanted actually to be the machine that is stripped of a conscious mind? What did a machine symbolise to him? Only the repetition pattern? What do you think?
I think this is part of it. He is, in a way, taking his agency out of his artwork, stripping his meaning out, but this makes the viewer's agency stronger. In the end, it is us, standing before light colored repetitions of the electric chair, dollar signs or soup cans, who will first lose their meaning and relationship to the real world object, and be forced into new meanings and new ways of seeing. I'm not sure this was what Warhol wanted to do, but he was more aware than many artists of the effects his work had on the audience.
 I just viewed the 24 hour live webcams established between EarthCam, The Andy Warhol Museum and St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church in Pittsburgh, and I am left a bit speechless. It is past #TIMEREFPM here in Siem Reap, Cambodia, yet I was allowed almost by magic to hear car traffic unlike any I have heard in over a decade and listen to tiny birds chirp as I viewed three Campbell's soup cans atop and little American flags wave near Andy Warhol's grave at what I imagine is #TIMEREFAM on a normal Monday morning in May in Pennsylvania. Then I viewed the live feed set up within the very church a young Andy Warhol would sit with his devout mother sometimes for as long as eight hours and I saw the same iconostasis that Warhol would sit and stare at for hours on end. I can now easily understand how all of the artistic themes explored in Warhol's works have their roots in the repetitive rituals of his childhood. The music was peaceful and eeery. If you have not visited this website, be prepared for subtlety, contemplation, and the infinite luxury of boredom. I am going back tomorrow during my four hour long lunch break to contemplate Warhol's Last Supper Dove and the final writing assignment for this my delightful first MOOC experience.

147,Can you watch the Empire State for 8 hours ?,warhol-001,1,elaborates,"Warhol ""played"" with time perception and the different reactions to the film. IÂ´m sure some of the viewers may have thought they were losing their time:)
I think that Empire would be perfect shown on a white wall at a cocktail party-- i.e. don't sit in a chair in front of it and watch it, but refer to it again and again as as beautiful backdrop to what ever is going on in the lives of those around it. This would be especially effective if done in a desert or in an equally rural or remote location. I think Andy would approve of any use of his artwork, if it gave pleasure to some AND they paid a fee for viewing.
I like your idea, and nice remark for the fee. :) In the first week's reading, it was said that Andy didn't even sit still for three minutes to make those Screen Tests , so I really doubt if he himself ever intended to play and watch all those ""Still Movies."" 
To be honest, no; I could not watch it for eight hours. It was creative, but who could maintain their interest for so many hours?
well regardless if they were or not losing their time we do have to agree that watching it for eight hours can be painful :-) 
Not really, but I really appreciate the play with time and perception (what is important to Warhol) that the film generates.
Even Glyn says u might get bored u might fall asleep in the video :-) 
","I like your idea, and nice remark for the fee. :) In the first week's reading, it was said that Andy didn't even sit still for three minutes to make those Screen Tests , so I really doubt if he himself ever intended to play and watch all those ""Still Movies.""

148,Empire: About the title,warhol-001,1,resolves,"I couldn't help but to think about the title ""Empire"" and its relation to the long, expanded ""temporality"" of the film. I wonder if Warhol didn't pick up the building as a symbol of the political role the USA had in that time (in a Cold War context) and created such a long film to stress the status quo of the American society. The course didn't actually directly approached Warhol's works from a historical point of view. I think we could use this space to discuss it a little bit.

149,Screen Tests....Really?,warhol-001,1,elaborates,"After viewing the first weeks lectures, I was curious about the screen tests done by Warhol. So...of course, I found them on #URLREF Initial reaction: huh??? Had Warhol just used the video footage of his subjects? or did he really put it all together as viewed on YouTube #MATH. This one was a little more interesting...she plays with her hair, picks up a magazine, turns it into a telescope, even smiles at the gesture...and I admit, I gave a little laugh as well. In general though, his subjects look quisitive, puzzled, scrutinizing, bored, and their facial expressions often seem to question ""what the hell am I doing here?"". Curiously enough...I long to watch more. Perhaps that is the realization of Warhol as an artist...great ones always leave you wanting/anticipating more. 
Try watching Sleep or the film of the Empire State Building, then. ;) I went to a screening of the screen tests at the Museum of Fine Arts Houston several years ago and am proud to admit that I was one of the few people who managed to sit through the whole thing. Most walked out, of course, which is understandable. I'm sure I at least nodded off a few times. If you found some on YouTube with music, though, I'm fairly certain that was added as everything that Warhol recorded was silent in the case of the screen tests. In regards to another thread, I think the screen tests may be the closest Warhol ever got to an actual ""critique"" of celebrity. Of course, screen tests are a real thing and were actively used by Hollywood in the ""golden age"" and beyond to judge how actors and actresses could portray certain emotions, etc. So for Warhol to engage in the same sort of activity but instead with his Superstars and others from the art world and underground scene forms a sort of commentary about who and what was allowed to become famous.
Lisa: My initial reaction to your question, "" why did Warhols original screen tests need to be more than a minute at most?"", is they didn't have to be. More than likely, there wasn't any ""real"" reason, other than what Ronald Fortuna (the post below) mentioned about the length of the reel, which I think, in all honesty, is the only defining factor in Warhol determining the length of his screen tests. I think his screen tests are mesmerizing for the same reasons people watch videos of car accidents or horror movies or read those terrible celebrity magazines: People want to know what happens next. I also think it's because the videos make the viewer slightly uncomfortable because of the eye contact between the subject and the viewer, even though, one can't see the other and vice versa. There's a sense of voyeurism that we may feel by watching a person do something, or nothing at all, without their permission and that, we know, is ""wrong"". Finally, I also see Warhol's screen tests as a challenge- not only to the subject, being faced with the task of sitting in front of video camera for whatever length of time, but also for the viewer, who is faced with the decision whether or not to watch the film, which is slowed down from 24 to 16 frames per second. 
The screen tests were all actually silent.Musicians Britta and Dean were commissioned to do a soundtrack for ten of the screen tests which is available on DVD. I find them mesmerising and quite hypnotic. The length of the test was due to the size of the film reel that Andy was using. Warhol often filmed things in a static way...like his film of the mpire State Building - which I believe is around 8 hours long. 
Lisa-I am puzzled by the screen tests as well. One thing that surprises me is the willingness of the subjects to just sit there. I wonder how Warhol convinced them to do it and what the subjects thought the purpose was.It comes across as a mutual admiration society-Warhol was fascinated by his subjects and the subjects were fascinated by Warhol. 
But how significant of a ""slowing down"" is going from 24 to 16 frames per second as Lisa mentioned above? The films she shared on YouTube don't feel very slow-motion... It's kind of interesting that Warhol only adjusted the speed fractionally -- it's quite subtle, really. I wonder what his thinking was behind this.
I find them quite mesmerising too, but see them as portraits rather than what we think of as screen tests. 
 Yes Kristy, I think that's right. Bill Viola's work is pretty different from Andy's and much more produced, but Andy and Viola share that they're using Hollywood's tools to create works that have very different intentions from Hollywood's product. It's interesting to consider what cinema could have been if Hollywood hadn't colonized it. Or what television could have been. Or today as we watch The Internet that brought us freedom from old media's commodity culture being slowly recolonized by that very old media. Perhaps the dominant use of a media becomes its default, and alternate uses, like Andy's Screen Tests, become contentious others. 
I love watching Warhol's screen tests. Just saw a few at a gallery in Las Vegas this year. It seems it was a required ritual every time a new person visited the factory. I thought to myself, if it were me, and I was directed by Warhol to just sit and look at the camera for a couple of minutes before I could enter the party going on, what would I do? It was interesting to watch how comfortable some were, versus how self conscious others were. Plus, these extended portraits give you a great idea of how a person would look on film, and some great insights into the personalities. 
'Screen test' can maybe be read in two different ways - the traditional test to test an actor or lighting etc or, in this case, a test of the people being filmed and put under extended scrutiny for the screen. One minute of filming might feel quite comfortable for the subjects, by extending it more of them will be taken out of their comfort zone. With the screen tests of celebrities in particular, focusing on their moving faces for more than a few moments can make the viewer look at and see them differently - making them seem more 'human' than the 'icons' we thought of them as before. So Warhol both creates celebrities and makes them more like us again.
Yes, the screen tests let you see the ""aura"" of the subjects.
Its hard not to see some of these screen tests as anything other than people just posing. I find watching people intriguing, but some of them just seem so put on. Nico- such a beautiful girl- but is it that intriguing? Shes just posing and looking around. Is there more to it im not seeing?
I think the screen tests are brilliant. They are about ""the gaze"" and looking. I mean what is visual art about if not looking. The screen tests are also about getting behind the masks that all people wear and probably especially celebrities. And we know that Andy wore his Andy suit and he was in many ways a facade. But having the camera on the sitter with the sitter having no purpose really but to sit and look at it causes the person to react. When the viewer's eyes meet the subjects eyes, i feel we somehow feel voyeuristic...like we are peeping into a show where we are taking something from the subject against their will. Also, their are comparisons to be made between the screen test and the traditional practice of sitters ""sitting to"" an artist, and in many cases this was a strenuous and stressful process. There is something very disturbing, too, about the screen tests. It is that looking at them now.....with the subjects being either dead or old (Sedgwick and Dylan), the passing of time and the fleeting nature of human life, of our life is more poignant. And I find them rather dramatic. The screen tests offer many points of entry for the viewer and lots to ponder and take away. I like them very much. 
Many screen tests show a diversity of behavior models pictures, but surprisingly little improvisation. The models actually seem to have been caught and about to be interrogated, but the question is never . 
Screen tests use the concept of repetition to make people seem boring and ordinary. In my understanding, Warhol was all about making everything seem tangible. Screen tests appear to be an extension of this.","Lisa: My initial reaction to your question, "" why did Warhols original screen tests need to be more than a minute at most?"", is they didn't have to be.

151,Andy's Alternative Cinema,warhol-001,1,elaborates," Of course we call Andy's filmmaking alternate. But that almost doesn't put a fine enough point on it. The history of media is the repeating story of wild, game changing, Utopian dreaming, innovation, that is colonized and domesticated to... well... to present the banal culture Andy celebrated in the pursuit of selling the products he immortalized: Coca Cola, Soap, etc. About already enslaved media like Radio, Film & Television we can ponder ""what if?"" About The Internet, currently under the lash, but not yet completely domesticated, we can battle over Net Neutrality. Andy may have idolized celebrity, but his filmmaking was about as un-Hollywood as one can imagine. What would our world, our media, and our culture be like in some alternate reality where ""Hollywood Filmmaking"" never really took hold, and style was dominated by ""Warhol Filmmaking""? When I look back at the Screen Tests of half a century ago I see Andy prefiguring aesthetic pursuits ranging from Bill Viola's oeuvre to Marina Abramovic's The Artist is Present. We often think of Andy as pop superficiality, yet the Screen Tests offer an intensity of lived presence that Hollywood Filmmaking doesn't dare consider.

152,The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,warhol-001,1,elaborates,"Walter Benjamin's seminal ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"" #MATH is dependent on our perception of it as singular but also on some ineffable unreproducible uniqueness. This may work for painting and sculpture but clearly does not for AW's chosen media: film, photography and silk screen, all of which can be said to have no singular original. This is even more the case with digital images that are infinitely repeatable AND lacking in materiality.

153,the role attributed to Andy's mother,warhol-001,7,elaborates,"What about this segment of Andy's life?
 Bob Colacello: ""The last portrait Andy [Warhol] painted at the old Factory in 1974 was of his mother, Julia Warhola, who had died two years before, though Andy avoided telling anyone about it, including Jed [Johnson]. Julia had been in a Pittsburgh nursing home for nineteen months before she died... Andy had avoided mentioning that fact, too, and Jed was under strict orders not to say a word. Andy paid for the nursing home, but never visited her there. He called her every day and she begged him to come see her...""

The artist just simply manually tweak the background and dress, without manipulating her face. Andy's mother, Julia, tried to compensate for the loss of her husband directing his affection for his children. When Andy was a child he had a nervous disease and his mother kept him busy with creative activities: comics, books, newpapers and he discovered hollywood stars ....
 Coincidently, Antiques Road Show recently featured some Soup Cans signed by Warhol. The owner of the cans had known Warhol, and had asked him specifically to sign the cans. Warhol signed each of them twice for good measure. He also had also bought a Campbell Soup can poster for a few dollars. They were worth tens of thousands of dollars now. It was great seeing them. 
I'm not sure that a mom in a nursing home in Pittsburgh would rate very highly in his celebrity world. His whole persona (thinking about this at this point in my course) seems very disconnected from people that couldn't get him where he wanted to go (godfather of Pop Art).
The online article ""The Mother"": #URLREF-content/uploads/2014/02/#URLREF 
 I don't think Andrew Warhola would have become Andy Warhol without his mother's influence. She supported his drawing when he was a child, brought him to church (the art within the church was a great influence on his style), lettered some of his early efforts (pamphlets of art he distributed to commercial art editors and friends, even signing his name on them), and did an excellent job of smothering him with attention from his birth to her death. She would watch him sleep as a child and even as an adult - an influence on his film 'Sleep' from 1963?","#URLREF#URLREF-XpHHIDldiKE/TyR9Plwjy2I/AAAAAAAABjQ/ElcsunTlCww/s1600/mother%252Cwarhol-julia-warhola-#URLREF Warhol did this portrait of his mother, the woman probably more influenced him.

155,Copyright,warhol-001,1,elaborates,"what are the current laws against the appropiation of art in the U.S and internationally? Can a collage artist use magazine images and not get sued? are art galleries afraid of representing artists that are using appropiation due to the rise of copyright laws? 
Unless an image is in the public domain, it is protected by copyright. This applies to 2D and 3D images. Technically you are supposed to get the permission of the image's creator, even if you are using a portion of it. Sometimes it is hard to identify who that might be. This restriction includes using images on blogs, but excludes one-time use for educational purposes. The reality is, we all do it to some degree and will not likely get into trouble for this behaviour, until we become as famous as Warhol. There's a common language summary of US guidelines on copyright #URLREF
In Argentina copyright laws are really strict, since there's no such thing as ""fair use"" (which the US legislation stipulates) when it comes to visual arts. Not only a artist could get sued for making collages with copyrighted works, but they also have to pay for the use of works that are under public domain to the National Fund of Arts- in that case they're not seeking for permission, just paying some sort of tax, and the collected money is used by this institution to create art prices, scholarships, exhibitions, etc. Nevertheless, local artists are quite ill-informed on this subject, and they take the risk anyways...
That's a great question Karen. Were the copyright laws different in the 1960s? How did Warhol get away with using images of Marilyn and Elvis for example? I'm sure if I borrowed a photo of Lady Gaga or Lana Del Rey and used it for an artwork, their lawyers would be right on top of it. On the other hand, I'm sure Campbell's Soup was flattered by the free publicity. They actually released 50th anniversary momento soup cans in late 2012! They're selling for $40+ on E bay now!!

I guess you could pay attention to the work of current chinese contemporaries in the Political Pop scene, such as Yue Minjun and Wang Guangyi. They use a graphical style similar to Warhol's to critique China's current emphasis on consumerist and celebrity culture. Warhol has a very broad influence on many modern day artists. #URLREF#URLREF 
Takashi Murakami? Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons? 
 Murakami's animated video for Kenya West's ""Good morning"": #URLREF#URLREF?v=6CHs4x2uqcQ In my opinion this video sets as an example of collaboratin with contemporaries in other fields (""celebrities""). 
I wouldn't include Cindy Sherman in the same vein as Andy Warhol. Sherman wears wigs and outfits, and looks different from image to image. And none of the images are of Sherman but of the character she is playing. Sherman is quite anonymous in her images. Would you recognise her if you met her? Warhol wears more or less the same wig, more or less similar outfits, and is creating an image of Andy Warhol. I reckon, I reckon. 
I would consider Shepard Fairey to be working in a similar style to Warhol's early celebrity images. Something that I find interesting is that Warhol used to be able to ""appropriate"" images to transform into his art. When Shepard Fairey created his famous Obamam HOPE poster the news photographer who took the original image of Obama claimed it was copyright infringement. I don't think anyone could get away with using commercial images in art these days. 
George W. Bush's portraits of famous people are taken from Google Images - so there is at least one person getting away with using commercial images.
Hello I think Jean-Micheel Basquiat. who had collaborated with Warhol. They will inspire each other.

John Stezaker appropriates old Hollywood PR photos to critically reexamine the cult of the celebrity. While infinitely more closely associated with Surrealism, than Pop, his strategies of collaging and appropriation examine the culture's obsession with celebrity rather than worship it a la Warhol.

 That was totally unexpected. I like. Also chuck close. Who isn't influenced by Warhol - these days it seems sequential design is just part of the process, right? 
I have an acquaintance #MATH while San was living in Greenwich Village. 
Let me suggest the film Exit Through the Gift Shop, and while it is about art (mostly street artist Banksy), it is also (probably) about the creation of an artist (or ""artist"") in the person of Mister Brainwash. Who gets his 15 minutes of fame, to boot. #URLREF?ref_=nv_sr_3

158,Warhol and me: a basic values difference?,warhol-001,1,elaborates,"Watching the videos for the first week, I realized that part of what is challenging for me around Warhol's work boils down to a fundamental values difference between us. He seems to be captivated by not only the concept of celebrity but also the mainstream (I'm thinking of Campbell's soup, etc.). I hope to learn more in this course and figure out what interesting take he has on these concepts but so far it appears to me that he is just fueling the value of celebrity worship and the mainstream. I find this hard to get behind. I suspect that I am missing his point so I have tried to view his work through different lenses: Freudian, anthropological, etc. but if I have to work this hard to try to find an angle that says something interesting, I feel that I am likely to be putting words in his mouth, so to speak. Is his work just too ambiguous for my taste? Possibly. 
I'm glad to see that I'm not alone. I just don't ""get"" his work. It's interesting but taken individually none of his works seem particularly well done or innovative. And as a body of work I'm left thinking that it's such a waste of talent. He's a fascinating individual but he seems to just embody celebrity for its own sake. 
You are definately not alone, most people have the same problem when they come in contact with pop art, including me! So, first of all, I think a mistake most of us do, not only about Warhol and Pop Art but for art in general, is that we think based on today. It's totally normal of course, but, to comprehend the art of the past better, we should consider the circumstances at the time the work was produced. For example, the era in which Warhol started working, was post war America. The States had just started emerging dynamically after WW 2, while most of the other countries that were involved suffered great damage. Industrialization was growing RAPIDLY and money started flowing in. All this was new to the people of the country so it must have been something fascinating, the ""American Dream"". Everybody got infatuated with these new things, whether it was mass produced things or celebrities, but in reality, all it created was an illusion of fulfilment, and that's exactly what Warhol and other pop artists critisize or emancipate. For example, by multiplying pictures of Marylin Monroe -and other celebrities- he took away ALL meaning from her. He emphasized on the symbol, the icon that Hollywood had created, not the human Marylin. He said he loved all things pop, but at the same time, I believe he completely understood the emptiness of it all and that's why he liked it so much, because thanks to that, he could hide comfortably behind a persona. After all he was very shy, as far as I know. And all of this is reflected on the way he was using to make his works, screenprint, so the works looked like they were manifactured in a factory, not made by hand. As for the depth of his work, there was nothing specific. Not in the meaning of philosophical backgrounds ect, at least. I believe that in order to understand pop art, we just have to think about life and our own experiences and let go, because what's happening now in the world and pop culture, is what was happening then, multiplied by 100! And that's another mistake we often do, we try to find a meaning in everything and we get too deep in theories and histories. Sometimes a painting can be just aesthetically pleasing and I don't think it diminishes its value, we just have to see it for what it is. And pop art is all about appearance, surface and color! So that's my view, or at least part of it, since it's a huge discussion! I am by no means an expert, but I have been reading about pop art for quite a few years now so I think I could give you an idea of what it's all about. Of course, from now on it's up to you, but I would encourrage you to keep on exploring it, it's very interesting. 

 Always consider Warhol one of those people who can fully understand the time in which they were living, the hole society and the future projection of his own present. The introductory video to the theme of celebrities by Glyn Davis confirmed me this personal appreciation. Warhol understood the consumer society and gave new products to consume: new celebrities, new artworks as close to them as the products they saw on television. The very same boxes of soap that the working class could see at the supermarket. He began as a collector of portraits of famous actors and ended being acreator of new celebrities. Warhol predicted the new purpose of the twentieth-century American society, everyone wants to be famous and everyone can be famous. There is a new paradise for this society: the celebrity, hollywood, to became famous no matter what. And he also gave a new hell, the other side of the coin: murders, electric chairs and accidents. The other protagonists of his artworks and the media. 
I very much appreciate the insightful comments in this thread. You have given me a lot to think about. Maybe what is still confounding to me is judging art and its value or knowing which lens to use. I teach English #MATH. They are not as I believe Ben Jonson said in the First Folio ""for all time"". Maybe I am expecting such durability as a determining criteria of highly valued art and maybe that is appropriate. Maybe viewing Warhol's work through the lens of his time and his time only is the sole appropriate lens to use and I should be looking to learn about his time, not about my own time or my own understanding. Or I can learn about his time and his it informs my own time and my own understanding of life and the human condition. Lots to think about....",,6,0

I thought about his work and his vision...they are gorgeous #URLREF hope learn more because i love and i respect coursera and its teachers

Come on, Dan. Are you really complaining that a half an hour lecture is too boring to catch your attention? This is a free course, after all. 
Yes, but other Coursera courses have set the bar really high! Take a look at Archaeology's Dirty Little Secrets for example!!!
Totally agree but the Professor, Sue Alcock, is an exceptional teacher. My favourite Coursera course as she was so engaging.
I guess it's a conceptualization issue. For me, professors are not required to make the material fun in order for me to review it. I chose to take the course because I have an interest in the subject and that should be enough for me to watch a 30 minute lecture. It rubs me the wrong way when college level (or above) students imply that they should be amused in order to pay attention to the material. Sure, great professors know how to make their lectures engaging, but not every professor is capable of it. Complaining about a free course seems odd to me, and a bit entitled to tell the truth. 
And that is their right, certainly. Anyone who thinks the course is boring can drop it and do something else, that's a given. As I said, it's a conceptualization issue. I don't agree that the videos are so boring that they are unwatchable, especially because they are barely half an hour in lenght and everybody here is supposedly taking the course voluntarily out of some interest in the subject matter. 
I took ADLS 2014 as well; with Sue's videos, I had a grasp on what I should or should not be taking notes on. While I jotted some things down during the first video here today, I was a little lost on what to write down during the next two videos. Other than that, though, far be it from me to complain about a free course. If I don't like it, I can always un-enroll. =)
I have to agree with the negative posts. If anyone is not familiar with Warhol's associates, they would be out of luck. At least, have some titles with the spelling of the names mentioned. Of course, pics of Edie Sedgwick and others would be so much more helpful than just a quick reference to them. How about pictures from the Tate show mentioned in the interview? 
During the first week of the course i would have appreciated to have examined more in depth some historical and cultural context. I hope to get more of it during next weeks. 

And I think also not every student likes the way Sue did the video's at ADLS 2014. She was too much for me, tried to be funny all the time. But that's not a problem, that's the way she is, and I'm different.
I done the Beatles course and the lecturer was fantastic. I have to say the lecturer in the second and third video is very monotonous. The topic is celebrity, The fabulous life..... the lecture could stand to be a bit more flamboyant. (sorry)
 Which is of course what I will do if the course doesn't get more provocative and interesting. I don't think we're being rude by giving our honest assessment so far. I presume the people offering the course want some honest feedback on how it's is being received. Life is way too short to be bored and there are many, many other courses available vying for my time and attention. 
Giving honest feedback and your opinion is not the same as saying that the videos are so boring as to be unwatchable and implying that if that does not change you'll drop the class, as if you were someone so important that things have to go your way or else. That's what I take issue with. By the way, that's the proverbial ""you"" and not you personally. 

And that's why I said I felt that position is entitled. If entertainment is extra, then I don't see the problem nor the need to, as you put it, protest. If, on the other hand, the problem is that the course is too basic and you already know this stuff, that's a different thing. 
My last MOOC had all of their videos over and done with prior to the class even starting. Working on that assumption here (and based on how Dr. Davis replied in the thread about audio quality), I will reserve judgments and critiques until the end of the course. If this is anything like the last course I took, there will be start/middle/end of course surveys for that purpose, and perhaps even a 'suggestions' thread at the conclusion.

I, too, found the videos helpful and interesting. The themes were introductory, perhaps, but I assume they will become more in-depth. I do wonder about the week three quiz and just what we should expect with that. But, I learned some things I didn't know and thought the Tate Modern assistant curator was rehearsed and stayed on topic; it didn't seem random to me at all.
I have actually played the video and then engaged with the discussion threads whilst listening as I found it more like a radio broadcast. However, I am here to learn something new and that has been achieved. I wish I knew what I had to do for the piece I have to do for assessment next week as I would like to get on with it. All the MOOCs are different The Tate Modern curator has taught me something already and I now plan to visit in the near future as I see Marilyn Diptych 1962 is displayed there. Learning for Week 1, box ticked. 
To begin I ask an apology for my grammar, because my original language is Spanish. I think the course is perfect as are introductory courses, and which passes from his biography to the profession of the basic way ... and this leads us to investigate further for ourselves
I am from South Africa, I went to a university which is regarded to be a 'top' art school in our country. I am absolutely amazed by this course, I find it engaging and super informative. To be hearing from top academics and an assistant curator of the Tate is extremely cool! I feel so priveledged that a 'free' course can offer me so much insight and from significant individuals! 
Fell asleep during second video. 
I enjoy Art History and found the talks interesting. I am sure we will learn more as the course progresses.
For me The Scottish accent is so pronounced that I could not understand the words and the product was very disappointing as a result. Fiontan speaks as if he had the Elgin Marbles in his mouth. John Breeskin","Totally agree but the Professor, Sue Alcock, is an exceptional teacher. My favourite Coursera course as she was so engaging.
And that is their right, certainly. Anyone who thinks the course is boring can drop it and do something else, that's a given. As I said, it's a conceptualization issue. I don't agree that the videos are so boring that they are unwatchable, especially because they are barely half an hour in lenght and everybody here is supposedly taking the course voluntarily out of some interest in the subject matter. 
And I think also not every student likes the way Sue did the video's at ADLS 2014. She was too much for me, tried to be funny all the time. But that's not a problem, that's the way she is, and I'm different.

161,Is Warhol great because his work forces us to question our culture?,warhol-001,1,elaborates,"I have to admit, I was not very interested in Warhol's work before. I took the class so I could learn why he is such a prominent figure in the art world. Reading about him satisfies some curiosity, but interestingly enough, it is the discussions and debates that people have about his work that are more interesting to me. Is this the essence of Warhol's work? To question so called reality? 
I find Warhol interesting in so far as he is so independent and non conformist. I think he stands out like Salvador Dali as unusual and original. What is art? What are the limits? In the beginning maybe cave scratchings, then religious icons, then landscapes, then modern and pop art with a social message. what next?
 I think his work played on the vanity of the stars he 'painted' and I guess it gave him something to do. 
I think you are right. He had a thing about repetition. I suppose giving similar treatment to Marilyn Monroe and Campbell's Soup says something about his values.. 
 I like this chain of thought. Even in his repetition Warhol was different. He played with color and technique. I wonder if Marilyn Monroe would have had the 'staying' power without the art of Warhol? Perhaps the pop culture works both ways as far as popularity of celebrities is concerned. Whatever, his popularity has lasted 50 years and here we are studying him in a course from Scotland. Interesting. 
How much of Warhol's personna was for real and how much for effect ? Did he use bizarre aspects of his personality as a selling tool or was he genuinely eccentric ?"," I think his work played on the vanity of the stars he 'painted' and I guess it gave him something to do.

162,Conceptual Art,warhol-001,1,elaborates,"Was Warohl a conceptual artist, and has anyone got a good definition as to what makes a conceptual artists. ???
If Wikipedia is the font of all knowledge (cough) then Warhol doesn't get a mention. #URLREF#URLREF 
It's where the idea takes precedence over the aesthetic, i.e. the idea and the means of producing it are more important than the finished product. There is an interesting article which explains it in great detail here: #URLREF#URLREF-art/#ConArtWhaIt 
 I reckon that the means of production and aesthetic are paramount to warhol's image making. I believe his own personal process is central and also vital to his obsession with making - more so than the content of the image itself. On this note alone I feel Warhol could be considerd relative to concept art. Warhol takes ready made images of celebrity (in his early portrait years at least). He doesn't waste time contriving images of his own- he borrows them from popular culture. He gets right in there, straight into production. Ready mades. Not saying Warhol is or isn't a conceptual artist, it's just his process is, I think, the most observed and readily seized part of his work. Nah, I don't think Warhol is a purist conceptual artist like Duchamp, but he is definitely heavily influenced by and educated about them. My point is that the sequential design, the multiples and building of visual databases seem to be THE concept - his method of making, it's very similar, and related to the idea of ""procedure over aesthetic"" as you write above. But I think that because Warhol's subject matter invariably would be celebrity - at least at this point in this course- that his method of production and interest in sequence/collection could be overlooked as most important because it is so subtle and yet so obvious. Not so obvious as iconic images of iconic celebs mind you. Kirsty baring there is a definite sense of 'no art' or 'anti art' about Warhol works and I just love that rawness. It may not be Duchamp's Fountain but it definitely punches you in the face. I wonder if Warhol used a different kind of image, say a clichÃ©d vase of flowers, would it make me want to rock out like a punk? No. 
Conceptual art it seems to me an excuse to make poor art. It has to do with the idea behind the subject. Is related to what the artist is thinking and trying to share using an artistic expression. The conceptual artists is someone who is trying to make us reflect about what is going on around us. It's a kind of witness of our times. Honestly, I have problems to understand modern art, or even Warhol's pop art, cause I think there is a kind of fraud in these conceptual artists work. That's why Im here following this classes, is an attempt to change my mind and understand better this kind of art. 
Why do you think there is fraud behind Conceptual Art? Why is it 'poor art'? Isn't it admirable that these artists are able to communicate ideas that are provocative and nuanced to the viewer? 
I'm not sure i would consider Warhol as a conceptual artist in the fullest but i do think his art, sometimes, could be considered as conceptual. For example, regarding the fact that the importance in the art work is that Warhol was the one who thought of it, the creator of the idea . Whether he did it (with his own hands) or not, is irrelevant. 
Hello Young Ha Tan, nice to meet you! I guess Art always brings a polemical discussion, isnt 'it? We all have different opinion and points of views about it. To me, many of conceptual art seems like a fraud. Warhol is different cause he used to draw very well, so I think he had talent. But in cases like Damien Hirst for example, I don't think he makes art. I can't see a jaw in a glass like a work of art, but only as a Peace of scientific exploration. I think now everybody can be an artist, you don't have to be good to be respected as one. In Renaissance, artists used to work really hard. They went to school and had a very deep knowledge about all forms of art. Now, you can put a lot of trash together and say: Look what a beautiful conceptual art I have made! Sorry, But I can't buy this. To me me, this is fraud. 
Hey Tamara!! So glad to hear you're gettint to know a bit more about conceptual, modern and contemporary art! I trust that by the end of the course I'll fall in love with Warhol's art!! 
I would definitely say there was a link with Duchamp in Warhol's appropriation of the 'ready-made', but there is still a prioritisation of the aesthetic over the conceptual. In fact Warhol's position seems almost anti-concept - he is simply reflecting the society he lives in from his point of view.
Concept art is about idea (not necessarily 'meaning') --and to me, his coy nature of saying that things don't mean anything, or his lack of 'intention' was part of his whole act, and brings a deep and complex irony to the situation of images, media, the spectacle of our world that directs our desires. To make us aware of how fickle we are with images and that we do not think they have much power--but they do. 
Many thanks to everyone for replying to the conceptual art thread. It has been a greatboon to me. I recently started a course on conceptual art ,and must admit up to now has left me baffled. !!
When I saw some of his art work displayed they had James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Campbells Soup Cans...I suppose I would consider the pop art conceptual...the concept being pop...popular people, celebrities...popular soup...who has never had a can of Campbells Soup? Who has never heard of James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis...I would consider them all connected in pop culture in someway and would consider it concept or conceptual art....
Hi Pam, I agree with you. At minimum Warhol lapped at the edges of conceptual art. Clearly his Polaroids, which moved passed individual instances of portraiture and moved into something much larger and more conceptual. I do not have any problem framing all of Warhol's discrete works as well as the magazines, TV show, Factory as a a single conceptual work. 
Let's not be confused with art that is formed around a concept and ""conceptual art"". All artists begin with an idea (concept) towards which they work. Perhaps where conceptual art takes a new path is that it is not simply visual but intellectual too. The ""idea"" is part & parcel with the art. They cannot really be separated. Conceptual art makes statements, asks questions and make you think.
I would agree Catherine, I would say generally conceptual art prioritises the idea over the aesthetic. 
I think all of the art pieces are conceptual. The artist is a human with ideas and for him to make something he think about it first, even if it's a dream like the surrealist artist would say. So i think of if it came from a brain conception, an idea, an image, a phrase, something, it has to be consider as conceptual. Andy's art, for example, are the product of the idealization and at the same time degradation of the celebrity life style, put them in to the light but at the same time reduce them with the repetition, for example, is the concept of Marilyn's piece that was in the first video. The concept is in everything because everything starts with an idea.
 Andrea, I see the opposite emerging in Warhol's work, as well as, we'll, not degradation, but disintegration, I see the emergence of something imperfect and human, through a process that corrupts an already perfect image. It works to the deterioration of the perfect, #MATH. Warhol equally heralds and celebrates the celebrity, I think, and further elevates the icon. But I feel he also treats it with more human and imperfect hands. 
 And I like yours, it is really spontaneous letting ideas reel off of other peoples ideas. I don't know if I would have thought as I did without reading how you wrote above. Do you think Warhol thought about how an audience would read his images? Do you think Warhol contrived what we read in his images, or do you think that was not his main objective? 
I think he definitely think that that the audience would read this images in their own way but he might think it would be the same way as he did because he was such a public person and he actually write books about his point of view like The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again), so probably he ponder that the idea behind his work was clear. Is a guess answer. What do you think? 
 HelloÂ¡Â¡Â¡, before posting anything I confess that I do not speak English. I have taken the course because I study art history and I really like this type of course but there are very few in Spanish. As Celia Cruz said, my english it not very good looking , but I'll do the best I can. I'm Cuban but I live in Santo Domingo. About Conceptual Art Conceptual art is that in which prevails the idea of ââartistic achievement, becoming more important processes of intellectual development of the work that the formal elements, therefore I do not think Warhol is a conceptual artist. The origins of conceptual art can be found around 1917 when Marcel Duchamp with categorical naturally present the urinary in the first exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York , questioning the nature of art and undermining secular values ââso far claimed the academy. The art ceases to be pure representation and concept is becoming. Among the manifestations of conceptual art can be counted Arte Povera, the ready-made, body art, or spontaneous happenings or actions. I do not think Warhol is a conceptual artist, and not share the precepts of many conceptual artists of his time as Joseph Kosuth , Rauschenberg , Abramovic or Klein. But the concept, Warhol predominant form before content, appropriates the language of advertising and makes his way to express himself. I think he was the precursor of a new form of consecration of the artist, by the avid upper class eager to be part of an intellectual elite at all costs, taking at the most goyesco style their own dreams of reason. One example of this is his prodigal son Jean Michel Basquiat, a graffiti artist with great talent, as there are many on the streets of New York, with an unprecedented success without reason. To classify him already exists Warhol Pop Art , of which he is the father and has its unique characteristics including the references in popular culture. Like any artistic movement borders are very subtle and can see some conceptual in some kind of Pop Art , Pop in some of Dadaism , some Dada in Surrealism, and so infinitely , art is not black and white. 
Nice to meet you, Gretel. Thank you for your comments. I do see your point, but I disagree (gently).

163,Did Warhol ever presented an in-depth critique of the culture of celebrity?,warhol-001,1,elaborates,"Through his interviews or his artwork? Or was he more of an artist that just explored (or laid bare?) the mechanism or dynamics of celebrity? 
I know it's unattractive to answer a question with a question, but could he present a critique of the culture of celebrity? From my impression he was too in love, too involved, and too driven by it to give any kind of critique or objective reading of celebrity culture.
I'm currently reading ""A More Beautiful Question"" so your question is not the least unattractive to many:-) 
Not that I know of. His mechanism was to present that critique as art rather than something more formal.
I agree with this. As noted, he was interested in the process of celebrity as much as the celebrity itself. Think of all of his media that used celebrity - visual, magazine, film. His images of reproduction of celebrities bring to mind Walter Benjamin's The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.
Since critique can be defined as Observation, Analysis, Interpretation, and Evaluation, I'd say Warhol definitely was an acute observer, and he facilitated others to become acute observers. The screen test series helps viewers to develop (almost forces you into) observational critique of all the portraits you watch. Then it forces you to think of the whole history of portraiture before film. I think Marc's question showcases Warhol's too-close-and-too-in-love to perform an analysis or interpretation at the time. But as a director Warhol's evaluation of who to film, who to make prints of, and who to interview was key to the success of any project involving people, celebrities, or people he made into celebrities. As a director Warhol was a master of observational critique of his community of creatives. In relation to other art going on at the time Warhol could be seen as producing a responsive body of work that grew from his personal interpretation of the art world, advertising world, contemporary news, and entertainment world of the time. Warhol maintained such a neutral, step away-from-the-camera persona, that it's hard to say why he did anything, because he didn't actually say why. Now we can art historically interpret and analyze away. I'm looking forward to watching the MOOC and our art historian mentors work on Warhol. 
I agree that it would be tough for him to have a true critique of celebrity, particularly as he himself became more famous. From the outside looking in, it is easier to be objective, to remember what is the everyday person average. When you're in that world, though, when you yourself are famous, you must lose some of that objectivity, I believe. Things that used to be extravagant or exotic or even ""crazy"" may take on a more normal shade as they become part of your everyday existence. 
I appreciate that Marc has raised this important question. When I visited the National Portrait Gallery in London four years ago, I felt that many of the portraits of celebrities actually gave enticing insight into the lives of celebrities and invited me to want to know more about them. For example, there was a wonderful portrait of Germaine Greer by Paula Rego that I love to just look at and wonder about even though I know so little about the subject. To paint in this way, it seems to me that the artist has to be a little detached from the person and the celebrity-hood of the person being painted. In the case of Warhol, I believe that he was happy not to step outside of a self-referential celebrity loop that revealed little of the painter (himself) or the subject and does't really invite the individual gazing upon the painting to enter it. I mean, do we really know any more about Jackie, Marilyn or Liz Taylor because of his cultural production? That does not mean that they are not beautiful. But beautiful in . . . well, a marketing kind of aesthetic. 
I think the point is that we know less about the celebrity rather than more. Warhol is pointing to the creation #MATH To play on Hemingway, what is the difference between celebrities and non-celebrities? Celebrities are famous.
I just read over the postings and realized that Yong Hau Tan had initiated this thread. So my thanks to you for starting us out as well as to Marc and others who picked up the discussion. 
 I agree with the earlier post that AW offered less about the celebrity through the art he created. If we look at the process, he used images and techniques over and over and over..... He was distilling an idea, object or form for his own purpose, be it commercial gain or artistic endeavour. #MATH. Do we, as observers want for him to be offering a critique? Why is the art / work not in itself a whole or resolved outcome for the viewer? This post question is excellent because it raises more question than I can answer because it forces me to the question; what is it exactly that we want from art / artists? 
","I'm currently reading ""A More Beautiful Question"" so your question is not the least unattractive to many:-)

I don't think the answer is correct. Does anyone know for sure? If so, I would appreciate seeing an explanation.
I think the answer to the quiz in the lecture is correctly stated as false. Here is my go at an explanation. Please correct me if I am wrong. If an input is misclassified, but in principle is correctly classifiable by a perceptron, then the hyperplane plane defined by the input vector forms a new boundary constraining the cone of feasible solutions. Let us call this hyperplane *h1*. And let us call the other hyperplane boundaries of the cone of feasible solutions *h2*, *h3*, etc. Since *h1* intersects *h2*, *h3*, etc. #MATH, any hyperplane parallel to *h1* will also intersect them. To get to the generously feasible solutions, we just have to find the parallel hyperplane *hg* separated from *h1* by a distance equal to the magnitude of the input vector. *hg* together with *h2*, *h3*, etc. now form a sub-region within the aforementioned cone of feasible solutions, giving us the cone of generously feasible solutions. Thus, assuming finite inputs and weights, the existence of a feasible solution space implies the existence of a generously feasible solution space. 
Thanks for the explanation. I'm not used to thinking in the weight-space #MATH. The realization that the cone extends to infinity while the inputs are finite makes this seem clear now. One question, the inputs are finite, but does it make sense to say the weights are finite? Any given weight is finite, but the full weight space extends to infinity and we may need arbitrarily large weights for your explanation to hold.","I don't think the answer is correct.

177,Boltzmann distribution derivation (Lecture 11e),neuralnets-2012-001,,elaborates,"In lecture 11e the fact that energy probabilities for a Boltzmann machine are given by a Boltzmann distribution is mentioned without any proof. I looked up what seems to be the original paper #MATH is the same as that for a particle which has two energy states. A system of such particles in contact with a heat bath at a given temperature will eventually reach thermal equilibrium and the proba- bility of finding the system in any global state will then obey a Boltzmann distribution. Similarly, a network of units obeying this decision rule will eventually reach âthermal equilibriumâ and the relative probability of two global states will follow the Boltzman distribution"" This is unclear to me, even though I am not completely unfamiliar with statistical physics, and even have looked up a derivation of Boltzmann distribution from the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. Could anybody either explain it, or maybe point to some good references? [1]: #URLREF#URLREF~hinton/absps/#URLREF
The Perron-Frobenius Theorem implies that in a connected, non periodic system, there is a unique stable distribution. Then just verify that the the given distribution is invariant under the transition probabilities, and it must be that unique stable distribution.
Thank you, Douglas! It is an interesting idea, but I am being stupid and am not sure how to ""verify"" that #MATH. Then the statement is that the distribution will not change. Correct? Hmm.
For each $$i$$, check that updating the $$i$$th unit preserves the Boltzman distribution: For each set of values elsewhere, pair the prior cases of $$s_i = 0$$ and $$s_i = 1$$. These start with the same proportion as the result, so there is no change.
At thermal equilibrium the assumption of detailed balance holds, i.e., if $$W(A\rightarrow B)$$ is the probability of making a transition from configuration A to configuration B, $$W(B\rightarrow A)$$ is the probability of making a transition from B to A and $$P(A)$$ amd $$P(B)$$ are the probabilities of being in configuration A and B respectively, then at thermal equilibrium: $$W(A\rightarrow B)P(A)=W(B\rightarrow A)P(B)$$ From here you can derive the Boltzmann distribution, but its a bit involved. This discussion of [statistical mechanics](#URLREF?sa=t&rct=j&q=&source=web&cd=20&ved=0CKEBEBYwEw&url=#URLREF#URLREF#URLREF&ei=dsytUMnuApHWsgbS84GwAw&usg=AFQjCNHqDEyCJSR9FzpHPwLvKFbXGpl7YA| statistical mechanics ""statistical mechanics"") might help (see page 16). Alternatively, put in the equations given by Prof. Hinton, turn the crank a while and you can convince yourself that detailed balance is satisfied. Going deeper will take you far beyond this course. This material is usually covered in courses on Monte Carlo simulations, so googling that with detailed balance will give you lots of reading material. 
Thanks for the link. It makes for a good read.
Thank you, both Douglas and Anonymous! Let me see what I can get out of it. So let us assume the network is in the equilibrium,and so the ""detailed balance"" holds true. Let us denote by $$P_1$$ the probability that the network is in a certain state with energy $$E_1$$, where a unit $$i$$ has a value 1, and by $$P_0$$ the probability of the same state, but with this unit having value 0 #MATH}$$ and this concludes the proof. Note that I did not use the thermal equilibrium here! There should clearly be a flaw in this argument, but I cannot find it...
Yes. I suspect the flaw is in this multilying by $$p_{rest}$$: there is a hidden assumption there that probability of the state apart from the unit $$i$$ (a) depends only on the energy and (b) does not depend on the value of $$i$$. But in general this is not true, as unit $$i$$ projects back. This is true only in the case of thermal equilibrium, so that is how it sneaks in.
Anonymous- I don't think we need detailed balance here. That's for Metropolis Hastings, if we're doing MCMC. In this case, our transitions are just Gibbs; we only need to prove that the induced Markov chain is regular in order to prove it has a unique stationary distribution. Dmitry, what are you trying to prove/derive here? I'm not clear on what you are assuming, and what you are trying to prove from your assumptions. Let me give it a stab: **Assume** that we have Boltzmann machines as specified in the class. In particular, assume we have 1. links with weights on them, 2. nodes that take on the value 0 or 1, 3. a configuration energy that is the sum of the weights where both ends of the link of the weight are on 4. and the probability of that configuration is the exponential of the -energy divided by the partition function, where the partition function is the sum of the exponentials of the energies for all configurations And then **prove** that if we transition by picking a random node and then changing it according to the probability rule $$p(s_i = 1) = \sigma(\Sigma w_{ij}s_j)$$, we settle into the stationary distribution. Is that what you're trying to prove? And in proving that, you'd also have to prove that the stationary distribution exists and is unique.
Hi Anne, thanks for joining in. Isn't the fourth point you are suggesting to assume exactly what you are then asking me to prove? Let me clarify: I assume your first three points plus a transition rule. Ideally, I would like to prove two things: (a) such a network will inevitably arrive to a stationary distribution, and (b) this will be Boltzmann's distribution. But I am also happy to be a bit sloppy and assume (a) as well, so the only thing I would really like to derive, is Boltzmann's distribution. Actually it seems to me that the first derivation I provided above (starting from detailed balance) is correct.
Dmitry, if you only assume #MATH above, how can you even make any statement about probability? You haven't defined either a probability distribution or a transition function, so how can you talk about a stationary distribution? You've defined a configuration energy, but nothing about any relationship between one configuration and another. [edited to add: This was a stupid comment, see below.]
I don't assume your first three points only, ""I assume your first three points plus a transition rule""! By transition rule I meant $$p#MATH$$.
OK, sorry! I missed that. So now, with #MATH$$ is the probability of transitioning to $$s$$ from $$s_p$$? That shouldn't be too bad-- for every state, there are only $$n+1$$ ways of transitioning to it. 
Sounds like another way to prove it, yes. But for now I am satisfied with the proof outlined above: it is so simple that one hardly needs anything else.
 A Boltzmann machine is a thermodynamic system. At thermal equilibrium detailed balance must hold. If it doesn't then the system is not in thermal equilibrium. If you assume thermal equilibrium and make a few mild assumptions about the form of the energy function, then you can show that the Boltzmann distribution is the unique stationary distribution. Nothing else is needed. However, this is not a course on statistical physics. If your are interested check out Reif's book; however, this is going to take you far beyond what is necessary to understand how Prof. Hinton uses Restricted Boltzmann Machines.
Can we clarify the definition of detailed balance? The way I learned it, detailed balance is that $$p#MATH$$ term, and we haven't yet discovered even unnormalized probabilities for the states.
Only at thermal equilibrium can you assume that the number of a configuration is proportional to exp#MATH is the by-product of the Boltzmann distribution. You should not try to derive Boltzmann distribution from the transition probability. 
Interesting. There are different ways of understanding this. With thermal equilibrium, you can easily go from Boltzmann distribution to the transition rule. With Markov chain, you can start with the transition rule and end up with the Boltzmann distribution. Is this what you mean, Anne?
By the way, can anybody point me to a book or article systematically connecting thermodynamics with neural networks? Hopfield nets as Ising models etc. I would really like to see all this being accurately explained somewhere, preferably (but not necessarily) from a physical point of view.","Thanks for the link.

179,what is $$<s_isj>_V$$ ?(Lecture 12),neuralnets-2012-001,,elaborates,"My understanding of the term $$ _V$$ is that it is the expectation of $$s_is_j$$ when the net is in a thermal equilibrium and the visible units are set to $$V$$, or written more mathematically $$E^Q [ s_i s_j | V]$$. To estimate this quantity you would need to run the neural net $$N$$ times (for some large $$N$$) with the visible units clumped to $$V$$ until it settles to the equilibrium distribution, record the product $$s_is_j$$ and average over all records(these N runs). This should be done for each data vector, so if we have K data vectors we need KN runs. However in the learning algorithm by Hinton and Sejnowski as explained in the slides they apparently run the net into the stationary distribution just once per each data vector V, that is only K runs to equilibrium. How is that an estimator for $$ _V$$? Am I missing something here? Will appreciate any hint at this point! 
Now that I'm dealing with PA4, it occurred to me the same question. The notation suggests that the algorithm uses a expectation (mean) for each data case, which would require several samples just to get a Maximum Likelyhood estimate. But, if the datacases are many, the mean of one sample for each datacase over all datacases would be a good estimation anyway, so instead of wasting time to get a more accurate estimation it may be better to use that and do more training iterations.
This question, if i understand it (and i may not) also puzzled me, at least from the wording of the question in PA4. But, i will mention that you can get the right answer to Q5 by ignoring this, i.e. by taking the average over all the data cases each run one time, i.e. computing for each separate case only once and then averaging [summing and dividing by the number of cases]. And i take away from this basically the thing Miguel says, that it isn't worth doing this more precisely. It might be worthwhile to have staff comment on this issue.
Once you reach thermal equilibrium all the samples you generate are valid samples from the model distribution and you can use them to compute the expectation--you don't need to restart the chain for each sample for a training case. The expectation is over $$N$$ samples at equilibrium for the $$K$$ data points.",,4,0

Yes, I don't see anything that obviously breaks if you use a slightly different function.
Interesting question. I can think of two constraints on the activating function on the neurons: 1. The weights are learned with the states between 0 and 1. So the function should return values between 0 and 1. 2. The weights and the logistic functions together capture intricate logic interactions among features or inputs. Replace the logistic function with other forms may disrupt such implicit meanings. 
I have a related question. So in the back-propagation phase, the stochastic neurons in RBMs will be turned into deterministic logistic neurons taking the probability as its states. Is this right?","Thanks for the answers btw!

196,Practicalities of Thermal Equilibrium,neuralnets-2012-001,,resolves,"I understand, or at least I think I understand, the concept of thermal equilibrium described for Hopfield and Boltzmann nets. Critically for my question I understand that the net doesn't settle down to a single state, but instead to a distribution of possible configurations. I also understand how the update rule works. So here is my confusion: we run the update rule over and over and we settle to equilibrium, but how do we know (1) how many times we need to update to reach equilibrium or similarly (2) how do we know we are in thermal equilibrium? I understand we can sample the states, but it seems to me there are $$2^N$$ possible states (for $$N$$ units), finding an unbiased sample seems long/impossible? We'd have to run the update rule a lot... I guess another way that could ask my question: When we are updating how do we know we are bouncing around in equilibrium vs still settling? This information seems hidden to us.
Good observation. In the general case, we don't know. If we're running a Markov chain to try to simulate getting to equilibrium, in the general case we don't know when we've gotten there (when we've reached ""mixing""). We can make some educated guesses, though. There are entire courses and books about the issue. (Actually I think for deterministic Hopfield nets we can tell we're at equilibrium. Once every variable is happy and doesn't want to change its state to a lower energy state, we're at equilibrium. But if variables are stochastic, in the general case we can't know if we're at equilibrium.)
I'm not an expert in this field, but my first guess in practice, given a random walk on binary vectors, would be to pick a few sets of coordinates, and see whether the projections to those coordinates has settled down using a chi-squared test to compare the middle third to the last third of the path. There is a lot of interesting mathematical work which has been done on perfect sampling procedures. I don't know how much of it has practical significance, but you can find a survey of part of the literature at [David Wilson's site][1]. Unfortunately that page seems to be about 8 years old, and many of the links are broken. Here are a few toy examples of exact sampling given a different source of randomness than the target. 1) Suppose you have an unfair coin which is heads with an unknown probability $$p$$, and you want to sample from the Bernoulli distribution $$B#MATH$$ to lose -- the last person to receive the ball is perfectly sampled from a uniform distribution, even if you don't know what $$n$$ is. It's a nice puzzle to prove this with no computation necessary. Again, the probability that this process has not terminated drops exponentially in the number of steps, with a rate which depends on $$n$$. Those are warm-ups for the technique of [""coupling from the past""][2] which was Wilson's thesis. [1]: #URLREF#URLREF~dbwilson/exact/ [2]: #URLREF#URLREF
The problem is, you can ""settle down"" in one part of the space, leaving another part of the space totally unexplored. If you think you have two sample sets from the true distribution, and you compare them, and they look wildly dissimilar, then you probably don't actually have two sample sets from the true distribution. But if you have two sample sets and they look similar, they might both be from the true distribution, or they might both be from some other distribution that is not the true distribution. I think of Markov Chain Monte Carlo as being kind of like exploring a physical space, where you don't know know anything about it. So you're exploring the haunted house. You wander through doors, and you find the kitchen with the bloody tiles, the cobwebby drawing room, the sinister living room, a bedroom with eerie music and mice running over your feet, and so forth. And your friend wanders around, and he finds the same rooms. So you might conclude that you've explored the entire space.

One obvious method is to use softmax ;) Its output is automatically normalized. Another method is to parametrises the last weight in terms of previous $$n-1$$. The third method is to minimise the lagrangian instead of the original function -- $$F#MATH$$. [Edit:] This is of course for linear constraints only. 
But isn't that an equality constraint. I thought that, in the lecture, an inequality '$$\leq$$' contraint is implied.
ahh ... right the entire course till that point was about linear constraints, so I got a bit confused. 
In the lecture, it was said that you rescale if the weight vector is too long. So, test for whether the updated length of the weight vector is greater than the constraint. If so, rescale it by the constraint divided by the length. You could try to use a linear approximation of this: In case you start on or beyond the constraint, project the change in the weight vector to a component orthogonal to the constraints. However, this would allow you to overshoot the constraint, and if you start on the constraint you could slowly move beyond it with second-order effects.","ahh ... right the entire course till that point was about linear constraints, so I got a bit confused.

Question 6 states ""For this question, every arrow denotes the effect of a variable at time t on a variable at time t+1."" That is, there are no contemporary edges in the figure. For the logit case, connections between X,H,Y are contemporary and only H is recurrent. 
How do you know that connections between X, H and Y are contemporary? I don't think professor said that. The only way u can deduce that is by looking at the unfolded version, but that defies the purpose. So according to this logic, if somebody asks you ""What is the unfolded version of a RNN with one input, one output and one hidden unit?"" You should answer ""There is not enough information to answer this question. I need to know whether connections are contemporary or not"".
I don't see this question as trivial. Certainly the model of finite automata can be construed as somehow having a time dimension. What is the difference here? I don't hear an answer. I also would like to hear from the staff on this question. I presume it will turn out that these things are not like finite automata. But i'd like more explanation. The concepts of feedforward and ""recurrence"" [ != feedback? ] *should* indicate a sort of time dimension, if you will, on the analogy with finite automata and a lot of other things. (Circuit diagrams, etc) Why is this question being taken lightly?
When I saw Q6, the first answer that popped into my mind was ""None of them"", then I had to settle for what seemed the only plausible answer, and think about what the question's author really intended when he (or she) wrote that question.","I did not think about this question deeply, and i have a suspicion that if one does that the answer to this question becomes clear.

203,Power of recurrent nets is memory?,neuralnets-2012-001,,resolves,"One of the advantages of recurrent nets which is discussed in lectures is the memory they have, which is useful in NLP tasks for example. Do they also have different advantages for ""regular' tasks, which do not involve long timelines? This is not clear to me. Thanks!
I believe this is correct. As I cannot think of much other functionality comes from the recurrent nature. The way I see it is like this: Normal feed-forward networks have no sense of ""time"", unless your data input is a time based representation - I'll get to the differences in a bit. In recurrent networks, when you update the network to the next ""step"", I like to think of it as a time ""step"". As the inputs change over time, the network sees these changes in a certain order at a certain time ""step"". This allows the network to respond not only to the current inputs, but because of the recurrent connections - specifically ones that do not go ""forward"" towards the output layer, we are able to retain some of the ""information"" from previous inputs. I believe the power of recurrent networks is not so much just ""memory"" or memory over time, but how it can achieve this. This goes back to my first statement that a normal feed-forward network can still model/predict things over ""time"" if you provide it inputs over ""time"". But this type of network is limited to how much ""memory"" it can ""see"" based on how you format the input. In a recurrent network, it could potentially ""remember"" information from the very first input sequence. The recurrent connections, and actually the weights themselves #MATH, control how much ""memory"" is ""remembered"". This makes them much more powerful, because the network itself can be trained to ""remember"" as much or as little of the information from the time-sequence inputs as the training dictates. Back to your original question. I cannot actually see a good use for recurrent neural networks off the top of my head that has a use, or clear advantage, over ""regular"" tasks which do not involve long timelines. I think long timelines is exactly what they are good for. If there are short time lines, then as I stated above, they could probably be implemented with a regular feed-forward net. Maybe another way to approach this problem is with some ""specs"". I think a recurrent neural network might have less calculations in certain situations. If only a few characteristic features from a timeline of inputs is required for the solution, then there might be less calculations required. For example, a prediction on a time sequence that only had a direct relationship to the very first input in the sequence might be more suitable for a recurrent network because a feed forward network that had all of the inputs would probably weight the rest of the inputs very low and thus have not much affect on the output. Potentially a much smaller, simpler recurrent network might have less calculations to deal with? This is all starting to get into theory and conjecture that isn't backed up with any math - I'm just postulating what may be the case, and maybe opening up some discussion by giving some viewpoints to think about.

205,Lecture 10 - Question about dropout,neuralnets-2012-001,,resolves,"It wasn't very clear if back-propagation is done when we are using dropout or not. It was mentioned in the lecture that backprop has side effects, and dropout overcomes those, but is that by not doing backprop and doing dropout, or do we do both. Thanks N
I'm also curious as to how the code would be rendered to implement dropout for the forward pass and back prop (assuming it is used). How would you randomly omit certain units when the matrix multiplication wants to multiply all of them? As far as I can guess, you'd have to either build new Theta terms from the original, then remember which terms were used so you can update appropriately. Or use the original Theta then replace the result of some of the outputs of the matrix multiplication with the original values. Then after the forward pass, do you backprop using with the same units omitted? Or does the error backprop through the full model?
Forward prop should be easy. You could zero out the units you want to drop by changing their outgoing weights to zero, which you can do with an element-wise multiplication of the weight matrix with a matrix of ones and zeros. Or you could zero out the activations you didn't want. But I'm not sure how you do backprop. Probably you assign a zero gradient to all the weights out of the dropped units and all the weights coming in to a dropped unit.

206,Lecture 11 - Initializing a Hopfield - First step,neuralnets-2012-001,,resolves,"Are the nodes all assumed to be set to 0 when a Hopfield net is initialized? If they are, I'm not clear on how the state ever changes. It seems like if all nodes are set to 0, then when we sequentially sample a random node to see if it prefers to change state, it would always stay stuck in zero since 1 * 0 for all adjacent nodes = 0 ?? (assuming there is no bias units.) It seems to me that in order to change states at least one other node needs to be already set to '1' in order to prevent the $$s_is_jw_{ij}$$ from always just being 0. I'm clearly not understanding something? Can somebody clarify or point me in the right direction?
After re-watching the videos again, it seems like we're supposed to 'start from a random state' which infers that we can set the values of each node to either 1 or 0 randomly as an initial state. Then proceed with sequential update. Clearly this is better than starting with all nodes at 0, particular in the absence of bias units. In essence it seems like state=0 for all node and no bias will always be a local minima for a particular net. (because there's no way that changing any single node to 1 would have an effect.)

So a weight from a particular movie to a hidden unit would be shared across all RBMs. That sounds a lot like dropout on the visible layer but instead of randomly dropping out units, the features determine which units are dropped out.

That's right. I think that one $$^T$$ dissapeared from correct formula $$c_f = ( b^{T} w_{f})(u_{f} v_{f}^{T})^{T} a$$ 
that was my conclusion too.
I too feel the second formula should be $$c_f=#MATHa$$ I have used * to denote outer product. 
sorry you are right, and it is equivalent to cedomir igaly's post above because #MATH
$$(b^Tw_f)(a^Tu_f)v_f = (b^Tw_f)v_f(a^Tu_f) = (b^Tw_f)v_f(u_f^Ta) = (b^Tw_f)(v_fu_f^T)a\enspace.$$ So yes, $$u_f$$ and $$v_f$$ must be the wrong way round in the second equation on the slide.
yes, you didn't :) i was wrong in thinking you missed a transpose.
So we are in agreement that the slide is correct? Ignoring the $$#MATHa$$ 
As Rafael pointed out, your last line is wrong because matrix multiplication is not commutative in general. E.g. as $$u$$ and $$v$$ are both column vectors, the $$i$$th row and $$j$$th column of matrix $$vu^T$$ is $$v_iu_j$$, but the same element of matrix $$uv^T$$ is $$v_ju_i$$. Also, you seem to have misunderstood what the rank of a matrix means. See here for an explanation: #URLREF#URLREF(linear_algebra)#Properties .

I thought it might help to do an example. Let $$\vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \vec{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\ 4 \end{pmatrix}, \vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\ 6 \\\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$$. Note that $$\vec{a}$$ and $$\vec{u}$$ have to have the same length. In some applications $$\vec{v}$$ has to have the same length, but this is not required in the generality with which lecture 8-2 introduced factors. $$#MATH\vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 15 & 20 \\\ 18 & 24 \\\\ 21 & 28 \end{pmatrix} * \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 55 \\\ 66 \\\ 77 \end{pmatrix} .$$

209,Echo State Networks and Extreme Leaning Machines,neuralnets-2012-001,,resolves,"It was great to hear about Echo State Networks, but why their static counterparts haven't been mentioned? In fact, they were mentioned but it was just one sentense ""we could try to generate random hidden units and train only linear ones at the output"" (in one hidden layer of perceptron). People experiment with this simplification of learning and they call this NNs with random hidden layer ELM, Extreme Lerning Machines. The translation to Russian sounds funny, I wonder if this is the same for English? An unconvenient name? :) Seriously, if anyone worked with ELMs, what do you think of it? Is it a promising method or is it stuck with the regularization problems? Does the Barron's paper [Universal approximation bounds for superpositions of sigmoidal function,1993] directly applies to this kind of model? If yes, it's useless in high dimensional problems. So all we can derive is initialization procedure for training ordinary MLP? The same question arises for Echo state nets: Have they died and became part of initializing procedure for RNN?
What I wonder most about them is how/why the hidden nodes are initialized and left without further more training. Will I get the same error rate if I just set all the nodes at 0.5 ? TAs I am looking at you :)
It's essential for hidden nodes to be generated randomly or, in any case, they must have enough variance among their parameters, thus, in their ""behaviour"". Then we can get, in some sense, ""dense"" response varying only output weights. And the interesting thing is that when the number of hidden nodes grows to infinity, all the possible responces of such network become really dence, well, as I imagine. But it requires more and more hidden nodes to get ""enough"" density when dimensionality of inputs (or states) increases, so it becomes infeasible for multidimensional problems as prof. Hinton said.

213,Lecture 9c - Adding Noise,neuralnets-2012-001,,resolves,"Lecture 9c is all about adding noise as a regularizer. Prof Hinton discusses adding noise to the inputs as well as adding noise to the weights. I'm not quite clear on when those things happen: 1. Inputs - I'm assuming the noise is added to the inputs during training only, right? Is noise added to the inputs when checking validation error? 2. Weights - The weights are initialized with small random numbers so adding noise at the beginning is nothing special. Where does the noise get added? Is noise added at the end, after appropriate training via back propagation? Adding noise during back propagation would just slow convergence and confound your decision to stop training. 3. Both - Does adding noise to both inputs *and* weights contribute anything or do they more or less accomplish the same goal to the same extent and thus there is no benefit in combining the techniques?
Regarding 1, I think the noise is only added during the training. There are several equivalent ways of viewing the noise. One way is to view it as a Gaussian prior in a Bayes treatment. Another way to view it is as a penalty term that grows with the square of the length of the weight vector. The effect of the noise therefore is to penalize the weights if they get too large during training. The intention of penalizing weights is to force them to stay rather small and somewhat near the linear regime, and to prevent the neural network from over fitting and getting so good with the training set that it's unable to generalize with the validation and test sets (someone correct me if I'm wrong!). During validation we're checking to see if we've successfully obtained a generalizing classifier, and at this point there's no more training, therefore no need to penalize weights etc. So it does seem to me that the noise is only added during the training phase.
It would be strange to not have the mean at 0, but we might want to use the validation set to figure out the variance.
I do not understand how the expected value of $$\epsilon_i^2$$ is $$\sigma_i^2$$. If the $$\epsilon_i$$ is drawn from $$N(0,\sigma_i^2)$$, shouldn't it's expected value be 0 (equals to mean)? I am having trouble understanding this part.
Thanks. I got it :)
Just to expand what John Lloyd wrote, to clarify what is true by definition, and what is true by algebra: *By definition*, the expectation of a random variable E[X], or $$\mu$$, is the mean. *By definition*, the variance, Var[X], is $$\sigma^2= E[#MATH]^2 = E[X^2]$$. Since $$\epsilon$$ is drawn from X, we have$$E[\epsilon^2] = E[X^2] = \sigma^2$$.

Charlie is correct. Suppose E#MATH = c -c = 0 Yes we can distribute expectation linearly. Its one the fundamental properties of expectation. There is no more rocket science here. Here if you are still not convinced #URLREF#URLREF#Linearity
try the following in octave: a=#TIMEREF; mean#MATH;
I know I'm late to the party here, but: The E[y] = c means that the probability-weighted distribution of y is c. That means that if you look at a graph that represents the probability distribution of y, its mass is centered over c. An easier way of thinking about this is that the expected value of y is the AVERAGE value that y takes on. So for instance, suppose that y from a uniform distribution between 0 and 10. If you were to generate a thousand samples from this distribution and take the average, you'd have a pretty good approximation of the expected value. When you take E[ E[y] - y ], what are you actually computing? You're computing the probability-weighted average distance of y from its probability-weighted mean. Consider the uniform distribution example above. E[y] = 5 here. So you're asking, ON AVERAGE, how much does y differ from 5? And the answer is 0, because ON AVERAGE, y = 5. Sometimes y = 10, sure, but it is equally likely that y will be 0. On average, each amount by which y exceeds E[y] will be balanced out by cases where y is less than E[y]. In fact, take ANY group of numbers and compute the average. We'll call the average $$A$$. For each number $$n_i$$, take that number less the average: $$n_i - A$$. Now take the average of THOSE numbers. You will find it must always equal zero. The actual math involved is basically: $$E[f#MATH/3 = 84.67.

Daniel, thanks the comments. My understanding of a random variable is exactly the same as yours (including the link you provided). I don't mean E[Y] will change.

When I see E[Y] = c, my interpretation is the population mean converges to sample mean and thus the subtraction results in zero. That is one way to see it. I agree with you. I am waiting for Tijmen to weight in on this to find out the interpretation of Professor Hinton. This is the second time I saw Professor Hinton uses this technique to explain the proof. I am very interested in learning how to apply probability theory to short circuit a proof to get what we wanted.",5,2

218,Lectures 11 12. What is purpose of hopfield nets and Boltzmann machines?,neuralnets-2012-001,,elaborates,"so I have watched lectures 11, 12. completed quiz 11. I kind of understand the algorithm and how to set all those bits, calculate energy, calculate probability of a certain configuration of units, etc. But what are we trying to achieve with all this? Is it just dealing with learning algorithms where inputs are binary and all units are binary? Does it somehow apply to learn to ,say, recognize digits? If so, how? there only some binary units keep changing to minimize some energy function. What is the purpose of this energy function? Does it represent something? like, how influential units are on one another? There was something mentioned about memory in lecture 11. but I feel it did not get clarified (or it just all mixed in my head) what it is remembering. Is it remembering some weights, for a particular configuration of binary units? It is all really confusing. P.S. In general, it would nice if the material was explained in a more simple, plain english. It seems that there is a wide specific dictionary in the topic of machine learning and it seems quite good to make us get used to it and be able to understand and use it. But it really gets in the way of truly understanding the material and introduces a lot of confusion.
After doing quiz 12, it kind of clarifies a bit. Apparently I did not catch the drift that we are trying to estimate the probability distribution of each unit rather than deterministic functions of each one another (which seems like what we have been doing in the first half of the course). Am I right? so far it seems we are dealing with only simplified case where each unit has cardinality of 2 (meaning that it can only take 2 different values) right? I am still not sure what is the point of this quantity called energy (in physics it makes a lot more sense but in machine learning context it is a bit confusing).
Tijmen notes that the ""energy"" terminology is just a holdover from the algorithm's origins in physics in this post: #URLREF#URLREF-2012-001/forum/thread?thread_id=984 .
So each unit has a bias and each pair of units has a weight. Both of these types of values can be negative, zero, or positive. If a bias is negative than all things being equal the unit wants to be off, if the bias is zero it doesn't care, if it is positive it wants to be on. If a weight is negative it doesn't want both units to be on, if zero it doesn't care, if positive it wants them both to be on. The absolute value of a bias or weight represents the relative strength of these desires. So the overall energy function is just the sum of these desires #MATH , and finding a global extrema of this function is finding the configuration of the units that satisfies the above desires the best. The remainder of the content is just essentially optimization/approximation strategy as the best known algorithm to directly compute the global best configuration has exponential complexity, and so is infeasible.","Tijmen notes that the ""energy"" terminology is just a holdover from the algorithm's origins in physics in this post: #URLREF#URLREF-2012-001/forum/thread?thread_id=984 .",3,1

Many deep learning researchers argue that pre-training helps performance in a way that it makes us be able to find a better local optimum ( so it has better performance) However, I can't find a formal proof to support this idea. The most convincing mathematical proof I understand is $$p(v) = \Sigma_hp(h)p(v|h)$$ So when we freeze $$p(v|h)$$ and optimize w.r.t $$p(h)$$ we get a better log-likelihood for the data.

What > is the energy of the configuration with the second lowest energy? Could you please clarify ""second lowest energy"" term here: should I answer with E in another local minimum or just another configuration, that is possibly not a local minimum?
I can now update with an answer (just tried myself with an assumption and got max points): all possible configurations should be taken into account, not just local minimums.

I wrote a sample octave code to solve this problem. You can do for loops (there is a way to avoid this) to get all the configurations and calculate the energy in each configuration by remembering that energy in our case is a quadratic form with can be expressed as the product of appropriate matrices. 
Wow...I just looked at the problem and wrote down the answers. Admittedly not a scalable solution, but it worked!

Ok, please guys, if you got it right and understood, please give some explanations. I've failed this question and I'm still failing to understand what's wrong. Without saying the answer explicitly, this is what I tried: for the lowest energy I turned some units of to turn off both negative connections and was left with a full triangle. I'm pretty sure this is fine. For the second lowest, I turn off another unit from that triangle (and was left, obviously, with just one connection). Does that look like your correct energies/configurations?

A negative reaction rate just means that the reaction is slowing down as the concentration of the reactant is increasing 
A negative reaction means that the concentration of the reactant or the product is decreasing.  When you subtract the initial concentration from  the final concentration, you will get a negative number because the final concentration will be less than the initial concentration of the reactant or product and therefore the reaction rate is negative which is also the rate of change.  Since the reaction rate should always be positive, you must multiply the rate by a negative sign.

Question 4: Is the equilibrium constant for this reaction different at different pressures? I'm really hoping for an answer from a chemistry expert - not looking to ignite any debate or controversy here. So if anyone out there who knows about chemistry can help me out it would be greatly appreciated. 
I just wanted to add that I am looking for Kc (rather than Kp) for the above equilibrium. Please, someone out there, help me if you can.
First you are ahead of me. Sadly, my job keeps me from working on this much. I just finished kinetics, but I do know a bit about chemistry and am taking this as a refresher... Q1) No the equilibrium constant does NOT have units. We are really measuring activities of the chemicals and at such low concentrations the molarity is numerically approximate to the activity of the chemical in question. Q2) would have to see the exact question Q3) Yes, if you ""reverse"" the reaction you invert the Kc. Q4) Kc does not vary with different pressures. Kc reactions have to be carried out at the same pressures to be accurate. You are measuring changes in pressures with Kp. Hope this helps.
I have had a chance to look into equilibrium and I found your problem about dinitrogen tetroxide.  Use the eqtn Kp=Kc(RT)^delta n power. The problem states Kp = 0.256, so Kc will be 0.0105.  This is due to the fact that N2O4 has a bp of 21C.  It won't have progressed very far by the time the temp = 25 C.
 I have found three sources on the Internet #MATH you get Kc=634! I wonder if any expert chemists at the University of Kentucky could help me out here. 
The Kp I found was actually in our homework problem. Sometimes they are giving real numbers, sometimes something made up. I guess this is made up. To convert this time you use R= 0.0821 because you are dealing with gases and the atm's must figure in. You don't use J/(mol K) since we aren't working in energies. Your even smaller values of Kc make more sense with the bp.
Okay. thanks Tanya
 Hi, I'm assuming R = gas constant and that the gas constant is the same in kinetics as it is in equilibrium. If they aren't the same, I would appreciate if someone could tell me the difference between them. In the kinetics unit we used the Gas Constant as 8.314 J/molK which implies pressure units of pascals whereas in lecture 4 talking about the relationship Kp and Kc and we used R = 0.08206 Latm/molK. In all of my studies I have never seen this value for R as I have always used 8.314 J/molK as that is the universally stated unit.

I believe the answer you are looking for is posted in the solution downloads... To determine the rate constant at this temperature, take a set of experimental data, plug in the values, and solve for k. In this solution, the first set of experimental data is used. Rate = k[X]^2 *[Y] 0.0016 M/s = k[0.01 M][0.01 M]^2 0.0016 M/s = k(0.000001 M^3) 1.6 Ã 10^3 s^-1*M^-2 = k The best value for k would be obtained by performing the above calculation for each set of experimental data and averaging the values together.

No Amber.  It does not work like that.  I began to do the same thing that you did until I reviewed the answer video.  It ends up that there is no constant for B.  So you have to solve for B first, holding A constant with experiment 1 and 2.  You will find B to be second order.  Then solve for A using the rate equation.  A is first order.  The rate = k = [A][B]^2.

hi melissa here. just wanna ask opinion about the Answer to Question 3 of The Rate of Chemical Reactions. It shows #MATH0.0267 M/s. My quiry is how does the rate of a reactant became negative in sign? Thanks 
Melissa, I think the negative sign is a typo...she states in the video that the rate can't be negative, which is why, when you're looking at the change of reactant to product specifically, you have that negative out in front. When you're getting the actual amount of change from R-->P, which is always final - initial, it will be negative since the amount of reactant is decreasing (the final amount will be less than the initial yielding a negative number). The negative in front is added to negate the negative obtained from that subtraction and make the rate overall positive. Sorry if that's too wordy...
 Shiryl--in the 2nd practice problem, the 4 in the denominator comes from the use of the coefficient for NO in the balanced equation. That's how you write the rate expression: rate = -1/4*delta[NH3] = -1/5*delta[O2] = +1/4*delta[NO] = + 1/6*delta[H2O]. The fractions come from putting the coefficients under 1. The first two quantities in the expression are negative because, as products, they are being used up as the reaction proceeds so their concentrations are decreasing. The last two quantities are positive because they are being produced, so their concentrations are increasing. I wrote the rate expression with the coefficients as fractions, but you can also just add the coefficients into the denominator, depending on your preference. So since the problem tells you the concentration of NO is 0.0100 M/s, if you use this concentration in the rate expression, along with the fraction you got from the coefficients, you get 0.0100/4. Hope that helps! 
Thanks Thomas! I know sometimes things print wrong, so I was wondering if I had missed something or it just wasn't there. 
I'm lost... on problem 2 of the Comparing Rate of Change for Reactants and Products practice problems, the only instruction I see is ""consider the following reaction."" What does this mean? What am I supposed to do? :(

255,Homework 2B question 15,casebasedbiostat-002,,elaborates,"The HW feedback for Q15 says the statement ""the single summary will be more precise than any of the stratum-specific estimates"" is correct. My background in chemistry distinguished between precision and accuracy. I think the statement ""the single summary will be more accurate than any of the stratum-specific estimates"" would be correct, but at least in chemistry (think back to significant figures) you cannot have a summary/derived value that is more precise than your starting values. Is there an analogous difference in statistics or is there no distinction between precision and accuracy in stats? 
I believe there is, but this answer option is misleading nonetheless. If, by chance, all my observations in stratum A are very well clustered, and those in stratum B are not, then the combined result may not be as precise (here in terms of its CI or SE) as the stratum specific estimate from A. 
In this particular case, the effect of having a disease seems to indicate people spend more money in about the same way. So getting more info about this way would lead to less variance in our estimate. Variance is precision because it measures uncertainty. For example, if someone estimates they are going to be ready in 15 minutes, they could have meant 13 or 16, but they don't mean 20, surely, if they are being so precise as to say 15. But they are usually late, and we know this, so 15 minutes is going to turn into 45. They gave a precise estimate, but their accuracy was off. The only real difference between precision and accuracy is some knowledge about what the variance really should be versus what it is being reported as. But, I'm not too sure, since it could have some specific meaning in chemistry. I can say for sure that taking an average gives more precision. Average a hundred 1's and a hundred 2's. First you get a sum of 300, with 3 sigfigs. That is an increase in sigfigs. Then you divide by 200 to get the average, 1.50 with 3 sigfigs.",,3,0

261,Question 19 Explanation,casebasedbiostat-002,,resolves,"Hi everyone, I had trouble with HW Q19/Quiz Q5 as well, but here is how I reasoned it out to get the right answers. I reasoned using Bayes' theorem that a likelihood ratio > 1 improves your posterior odds (and so indicates your hypothesis is ""well supported""), whereas a likelihood ratio < 1 decreases those odds (meaning the hypothesis is not supported by the data). Because there are 3 hypotheses, we have to calculate the likelihood ratio for each hypothesis compared to the other 2. So for H0: $$\frac{P(1|H_0)}{P(1|H_1)} = \frac{0.384}{0.375} = 1.02$$ $$\frac{P(1|H_0)}{P(1|H_2)} = \frac{0.384}{0.096} = 4$$ For H1: $$\frac{P(1|H_1)}{P(1|H_0)} = \frac{0.375}{0.384} = 0.98$$ $$\frac{P(1|H_1)}{P(1|H_2)} = \frac{0.375}{0.096} = 3.9$$ And for H2: $$\frac{P(1|H_2)}{P(1|H_0)} = \frac{0.096}{0.384} = 0.25$$ $$\frac{P(1|H_2)}{P(1|H_1)} = \frac{0.096}{0.375} = 0.26$$ From here you can see that H0 and H1 each have likelihood ratios which will improve the poster odds by a factor of 4, but for H2, the posterior odds with respect to the other hypothesis are not improved in either case. I'd welcome feedback on this solution as I am not completely certain of the reasoning. 
1st thank you for posting this. I feel like my head will explode if i cannot understand this and have spent the last 4 hrs mulling over this. To me it makes sense because after rereading the explanation I just arrived at this. However i have question about your conclusion H2 , when compared to 1 and 0 has low likelihood but H1 when compared to H0 also has low likelihood- 0.98. how do you take this into account in arriving at your conclusion given what you sate at the beginning about likelihood >1? Further, I read in one of the posts that likelihood has to be between 0and 1, which is not the case here. 
Usha, remember that P1 and P2 are the likelihood function above in John's explanation, and are always between 0 and 1 but the ratio of one likelihood function to another will not always be between 0 and 1. John and Usha, you actually don't need to use Bayes theorem to solve question 19. Just first find the row in the table that corresponds to the observed outcome (so the second row if the outcome is 1 person had relief), then find the value that is largest (= closest to 1 = most likely to happen) and that is the hypothesis that is the best supported. If two hypotheses in the row have similar value they are similarly supported.
Thanks Rachel, I now understand the likelihood ratio need not be between 0 and 1. for the quiz question 5, where 2/3 reported relief, the probabilities are 0.027, 0.375, and 0.243. So would you say hypothesis H1 and H2 are supported and not H0?

Wouldn't this save 1 cycle if the branch is correctly predicted taken and make it truly 0 cycle penalty? The BTB as described in Professor David course contains the target address and Branch address, I guess if the current PC address matches the contents of BTB/Br address, it is defined as taken although a more complex scheme could also involve the PTH and BHR in the model of BTB. Anyway, if you draw some timing, you can see the following: BTB as in the course, i.e. No instruction target in the BTB leads to:     cycle#1         Cycle#2      Cycle#3        Cycle#4     Cycle#5 F   Br_addr         Tar_addr D                         Br_instr      Tar_instr E                                             Br_Cond        Tar_instr W                                                                                   Tar_instr This is in its simplest form a 4 stage pipelines. As you can see, in cycle#1, the PC contains the branch address, and it is compared w/ the corresponding BTB entry and if being equal => PC contents points to a branch instruction in iCache. in cycle #2 it contains the target address, in cycle#3 it reads the Target instruction out of the iCache, etc. Now considering BTB including both the instruction target and address target, and branch predicted taken:     cycle#1        Cycle#2          Cycle#3                Cycle#4 F   Br_addr       Tar_addr+4 D                       Tar_instr, Br_instr E                                              Br_Cond, Tar_instr                W                                                                          Tar_instr In cycle#1, all happens as in the previous simpler BTB case #MATH. This obviously requires more read ports on the RF, so perhaps this is good for the super-scalar 2-issue which has 4 read ports. It also implies that the Branch when in exe has its own circuitry to perform the condition and assess whether the instruction was indeed correctly predicted taken while the Target instruction is also executing its operation. The later case, finishes one cycle earlier than the case where the BTB contains only the target address. Conditional branches are usually non intrusive, therefore should not change the register file. This saves one cycle, whether it is worth, perhaps only in the case of >= 2-issues. In single pipeline, cost of adding 2 register R ports may be too high and return on investment too low when putting the average branch rate, the correctly predicted taken, the ratio of non taken v.s. taken.

Upon read miss by P1, I would guess that all other Px will respond to the line miss request and inform P1 that this line already exists in other proc caches. So your second guess is correct. I don't think that there are other mechanisms to determine upon a missing line request that other processors have that line in their own cache.

275,L14S2 : Mixing non-Blocking Caches with the TLB Misses,comparch-002,,resolves,"It was mentioned during the Lecture 13/14 that in certain processor implementations, a TLB miss leads to a processor stall even as the ""Hardware Page Table Walker"" reloads the TLB with the missing entry.    During the lecture 12, the non-blocking Cache was used to reduce the miss penalty.   I suppose that it should be possible to have a non-blocking Cache co-exist with the TLB miss. That would mean stalling the processor only when data from the missed TLB entry is really used.   My question is whether it is necessary to Stall the processor pipeline in case of the first TLB miss? Am I missing something?  
Hi Yadav - I thought I replied but somehow I lost the contents. So here it is again. Issue here for TLB miss is that there may be a page fault underlying the o/s or h/w retrieving the missing page. I believe (but not 100% sure) that once the exception is handled by the os or hw, then the flow goes back to the instruction that caused this TLB miss, then reload page and update the TLB. If you let go of the instruction flow, you may commit instructions post interrupt which will put the engine in the wrong state. Those are my assumptions but again not sure, and I think this should probably be answered by Michael or David.
Hi Yadav-  Initial question was ""why can't we use non blocking when TLB miss upon a load instruction""?. I think the answer is that if TLB misses, you don't know when o.s or h/w will walk the page tables, whether you will end up w/ a page fault that will cause an exception. Under these circumstances, if you do non-blocking you may end up w/ instructions that will have been committed while an earlier instruction ( the one that caused the TLB miss) will be the source of the page fault exception. A TLB miss occurs because the page entry is not present, hence the MMU needs to access the physical memory (where the page tables reside) and retrieves the missing entry. Once this is done, the instruction re-execute and causes a data miss again and the TLB this time hits, a virtual to physical translation is being executed and cache block retrieved from physical memory and brought back into cache. Of course, you can have an early re-start so the processor can resume execution. However until then, the CPU is stalled. 
Hi Yadav - Yes, this is true, if direct mapped and non blocking load, you could have the same situation of page missing and s/w will have to reload the page from the disk drive. Not sure what would happen in that case as I think it will take an exception for the processor to initial the engine to transfer the page from disk to physical memory using a DMA. Plus if page is cacheable, Proc will need to flush out the cache lines that are dirty and mark all invalid? Anyway, I think this is beyond the question, plus not 100% sure of all of this. Sort of answering as I am writing but worth a debate.","Hi Yadav-  Initial question was ""why can't we use non blocking when TLB miss upon a load instruction""?.

That doesn't really answer the question. What is the program counter value then? Inside one thread multiprocessor you need to have the same PC for all SIMD lanes. If you schedule different lanes, essentially, you might need to execute different commands. 
>> Inside one thread multiprocessor you need to have the same PC for all SIMD lanes. If i'm not mistake, the SIMD lane is the same as warp - group of 32 threads or some other number of threads. So, you don't have to ""have the same PC for all SIMD lanes"", just same PC for all threads in warp or lane. So, perhaps each SIMD lane should have it's own instruction pointer. At least this should solve problem and it is easy to implement. PS: Hello from MSU, Peter! :) 
Nope, you get it wrong. SIMD lane is, effectively, a single thread inside a thread group. So the question, in CUDA terms, is: if ONE thread inside the thread group is stalled by a memory fetch, do ALL the threads switch to other threads with the same PC to hide this latency? If not, switching just some of the threads would result in threads having different PCs inside the same thread block. 
These 'lanes' are 'threads' in CUDA and C++ AMP terminology, and 'work items' in OpenCL terminology. You only need the same PC across these lanes/threads/items within the same 'wrap' #MATH when all threads in the wrap are completed. 
Yes. If half the group continues, other half is stalled, then by definition you have different PCs within the group, and that cannot happen...","Nope, you get it wrong.

278,Victim Cache and Write Buffer,comparch-002,,elaborates,"What is the difference between a Victim Cache and a Write Buffer?I have gone through some of the contents in the internet which say sometimes write buffers are called Victim cache. I am confused with this.
Victim cache contains the dirty line that needs to be written back to the next level #MATH that matches the address of the existing line, if multi set way associative, the line contains a LRU status bit that selects it as a ""victim"". In this context, one bit mentions that the line is not up to date w/ its next level memory, hence it has been modified during code execution. Write buffer contains the consecutive store data instructions. I guess it is used for all store access types, write through-write back and no write allocate, write allocate. It is sort of temp buffer that one can use for OOO memory instructions.
Both the write buffer #MATH cache lines. These evicted lines are therefore available immediately, without the need to reload these from a slower memory level.

For the IO3 processor, why not remove the instructions from the Issue queue as soon as the Instructions are actually Issued.   Though the instructor mentions though the Instruction could be removed as soon as an Instruction is Issued, the entries in the Issue queue are Valid till end of the pipe. This makes it convenient to mark the other other pending bits as being Valid #MATH - instead the pipeline timing is derived from the scoreboard.  - The Scoreboard can by itself be used to determine what  Register is in the Writeback stage, and this information could be used to update the Pending bits in the Issue queue.    So why maintain an Instruction in the Issue queue till end of the pipe i.e the Write-back stage?",,1,0
281,Reorder buffer insertion point in pipeline diagrams,comparch-002,,resolves,"I spent a ton of time on this tiny detail, so I thought I'll share what I found.  I was trying to figure out the rule to insert something into the reorder buffer.  I think I have it now, but please correct me if I'm wrong. As explained in the lecture, we insert into the ROB from the decode stage.  Fine, sounds good.  But the pipeline diagrams (say L6S4 slide 31, the IIOI processor) showed something different.  Look at cycle 4, as an example.  Instruction 3 is in decode stage, and the top half of the slide agrees.  The lower half does not have the number 3 in the ""D"" column, probably for brevity, but the instruction is really there.  So why don't we see instruction 3 appearing in the ROB for the next cycle, cycle 5?  Why did we not insert from the decode stage, as promised? Because that would be incorrect :)  The way I see it now, is that in fact, the decode stage IS sending the insert signals towards the ROB, but since we'll stall the frontend of the pipe, we won't strobe this insert into the ROB.  If we did, then a stalled frontend would enter multiple entries into the ROB. So the precise rule is: We insert into the ROB from the decode step.  However, if we can't issue in this cycle, then (besides skipping the the strobing of the PC and the IR), we also skip the strobing of the ROB insert.  Note however, that we might still strobe an ROB remove, if the commit stage succeeds in committing something, so it's not the whole ROB clock signal that is masked, just the insert selectively. 
I agree with your assessment. Looking at Slide 31, even though the Instruction 3 ( MUL R7, R5, R6 ) has been decoded, it cannot Issue as there is a stall underway ( Instruction 2 is waiting on the result of Instruction 0 from the Y3 stage of the pipe ).    So an entry is added to the ROB buffer when the Instruction ""transitions from a Decode to Issue stage ( say on rise edge of the clock)"". From a logic point of view, the combinational logic would evaluate the entries to the ROB buffer, but the evaluated entries would not be written due to the Strobe ( perhaps derived from the Stall signal ).      You also correctly point out that the Decode stage on Cycle 4 is evaluating Instruction 3.  Also that writing to the ROB at the end of the Decode stage would be a mistake because the Instruction has not really been Issued yet - the pipe is stalled.",,2,0

286,L5S3 : What are the advantages if any of pulling the Commit point earlier in the pipeline,comparch-002,,resolves,"Having a commit point later in the pipeline seems logical since most operations have been completed.  However, it was also pointed out that pulling the commit point earlier has been done in a few processors. Just wondering what is the advantage of having the commit point at an earlier stage in the pipeline?
On second thoughts, it could be that it helps us in situations where we have Out-of-Order Writebacks. Pulling a Commit point early in the pipeline may help in maintaining precise exceptions.  
The way I understand it, is that in the simplest case, you want every pipe #MATH to have the same number of pipeline steps.  This is a waste of time, if you have a one cycle ALU, and a four cycle multiplier: the ALU will have to be followed by three idle pipeline steps.  You have choices: you can build a true out-of-order processor, with reorder buffer and multiple register files.  Or, you can sacrifice precise exceptions. But if you dislike both of these, then pulling the commit point early is your last resort: in that case, the processor must have equal number of steps between the front and the commit point, but you can still have a varying number of steps after the commit point.  So this is a fairly simple in-order design, but you can still have a long multiply pipe.  You won't need reorder buffer or multiple register files, just a scoreboard, and you can have precise exceptions.

What is the difference between term ""register"" and ""cache""?         I know that physically the register and cache are quite close to CPU, but are they of the same function just call different name? By browsing the internet, I get even more confuse.         Thank you
 #URLREF#URLREF-#URLREF Registers are present inside the CPU, cache is present outside the CPU between the memory (talking logically here). Say an add is being performed on two variables in the main memory and is put back onto the main memory. First these two instructions are fetched from the memory and then put into registers. The ALU adds them up and puts it into another register. Now this is moved from the register back to the main memory. But one of the main bottlenecks is accessing the memory. You'll see some interesting numbers when you google about this. So to fasten up this, they introduce another small memory which is very near to the CPU which will contain (as a very simple example) the most frequently fetched values from the memory. Now when you want to fetch some operands from the memory to the registers you don't directly go to the memory. Instead you see first if it's in the cache and only if it is not present you go and fetch is from the memory. One advice: Not to demotivate you or something, please brush up or take a fast paced Computer Organization course, or else it'll be difficult for you. Seeing the first lecture I believe elementary things like this won't be covered well (in simple terms) in this course.

Caches are  made of registers.  There are registers used in a lot of different devices. Actually, I'll just write a wall of text here. In ""big pictures"" there are always tools that you put together to paint it. Think of Lego's. You build a spaceship with those little plastic bricks. The spaceship has a control bay. You build  that  control bay with those bricks. You build a couple more modules using those bricks; like the rocket engines, the storage bay, etc. When you put together those different modules, you build the spaceship. Effectively, you build the spaceship with those bricks. Think of the CPU as the spaceship in the above example, the final product you want to build. For this (immensely) complicated piece of machinery, you need a lot of different modules. You need a PLL to generate the clock signal, you need an ALU at the core to process (a subset of) your instructions, you probably need a GPU to be able to process the more complicated instructions, and so on. One of the tools you are going to use when building these things are registers. Basically, those are flip-flops connected in parallel that hold a stream of 1 or 0. For an 8-bit register, you lump in 8 of these flip-flops, package them as a standard circuit element and then use a copy of the same thing in whatever module you are trying to build. The above explanation of a register is very simplistic by the way. Modern day registers are stringed together in banks and they use really complicated circuitry to boost efficiency. Anyway, I tend to digress a lot. So, caches are these modules that are built using these registers.  The purpose of a cache is to store information so that its proximity to the ""core"" of the CPU can be exploited. Since your CPU spends 1/100th of the time to pull some data from a cache rather than go look for it in your harddisk, they are really useful.  Registers are the tools that are used in these caches to hold on to the data while it is waiting to be swept off its feet by the CPU. Disclaimer : The level of informality in the above text is enforced by Mr. Walker. Johnny Walker.
The cache is not necessarily on chip. Larger caches (L2, L3) could be off-chip as well as shared between multiple cores. 
Caches are not made of registers. It is just another memory type, which is slower than registers but faster than DRAM. 
My usage of registers in the above wall-of-text is a general explanation. General Purpose Registers in a CPU are specialized instances of the registers I am talking about.  Here is the wiki page.Read the last sentence of the ""Varieties of register"" section.

A very good example about computer memory is given in the following link: #URLREF#URLREF ""To see how registers, memory, and second storage all work together, let us use the analogy of making a salad. In our kitchen we have: a refrigerator where we store our vegetables for the salad; a counter where we place all of our veggies before putting them on the cutting board for chopping; a cutting board on the counter where we chop the vegetables; a recipe that details what veggies to chop; the corners of the cutting board are kept free for partially chopped piles of veggies that we intend to chop more or to mix with other partially chopped veggies. a bowl on the counter where we mix and store the salad; space in the refrigerator to put the mixed salad after it is made. The process of making the salad is then: bring the veggies from the fridge to the counter top; place some veggies on the chopping board according to the recipe; chop the veggies, possibly storing some partially chopped veggies temporarily on the corners of the cutting board; place all the veggies in the bowl to either put back in the fridge or put directly on the dinner table. The refrigerator is the equivalent of secondary #MATH."" Hope that helps. 
l1/l2 cache's are typically arrays of 6-T/8-T SRAM cells #MATH, modern processors like A15 support cache warming wherein caches are preloaded.

I would have expected the line to be in Exclusive {P1} state. When P1 refers to line 4100, since direct mapped cache of 4 kB, it points to block 0 w/ a tag of 4096 and offset of 4. The request is a miss, so P1 that had the line zero at block zero at time 7 has to write back the line at physical address 0 and set the line address 0 to invalid. However, block at address 0 has a new content from main memory address 4100, why is this line address of 4096 not in exclusive at this point but instead in ""share"" state although it was invalid before?
Hi Joseph,   The reason is that the Processor caches are following a MSI protocol, and not a MESI protocol.  It would have moved to an exclusive state for a MESI protocol.    You have suggested the right transitions for the MESI -  At Time 8,you have a Read miss due to the Load word for the Cache line address 4096. As you correctly point out, the Cache line is going to be evicted ( since it was reserved for Address 0 ), and then refilled with the data for 4096.   You may think of this as though the Cache line at address 4096 was initially in an Invalid state initially and then you have a read miss, therefore the transition would occur from the ""I"" to the ""S"" state as per the MSI state machine ( for a Read miss ).  If you had a Load word at time 8 for the address 0, then you would have seen the state machine to remain in ""Modified"" state. Regards, Pushkal

Hi Pushkal - I agree w/ you for the cache, but was wondering about the Directory base. Why isn't the line 4096 set as ""E"" from the directory perspective as it supports the ESU protocol? 
Since it is a Read miss on Time Slot 8, the Directory State machine shall transition to the ""Shared"" state ( Slide 16 of Slide Deck 15 ). Had it been a Write miss, it would have transitioned to the ""E"" state.
I guess, it wouldn't make any difference. purpose of the directory based system is to reduce traffic in all aspects, buses and DDR. If another proc would miss this line, I suppose the line will be delivered by the initial proc in S state under directory controller and this would be the same if the initial directory would set the same line for the initial proc to E. You are correct, I think that if the cache was in MESI, then I would suspect that the line would be set to E in directory after the initial read miss.","Since it is a Read miss on Time Slot 8, the Directory State machine shall transition to the ""Shared"" state ( Slide 16 of Slide Deck 15 ).

Ooops, cancel the above, I think there is a typo and the leaf should be on 53 to 62 which makes the 5 indexes all coded on 10 bits.  Also, 10 pages allocated to one process allow 5*8 KB max physical address space. Isn't it always true for any process page allocation?
Hi Joseph,    Let me list what I understand on this - had spent some time thinking about the number of levels and tried 3-4 different combinations.   It seems like the important hint listed in the question was ""construct a multi-level page table where the different levels of the page table naturally fit within an 8KB page"" .         Starting from the leaf level page , it takes 51 + 1 Valid + 1 Dirty + 1 Kernel + 2 reserved = 56 bits for a Single PTE.  In order to fit-in naturally , one can choose each PTE to be 64 bits.  That translates to 1024 PTE's in a Page of 8192 bytes.          In case one takes the ""non-leaf Page Tables entries"" , its shall take 51 bits to act like a pointer to the start point of a Page. These 51 bits that constitutes a Page Table pointer again would fit in nicely in 64 bits. Therefore each Page of 8 KB can contain 1K Page Table pointers and would need 10 bits in the Virtual address to point to the exact entry.      Looking at the Virtual address of 63 bits, and subtracting 13 bits for the offset, one gets 50 bits. That  would mean 5 levels.     To your question on why 63 bits of Virtual address was chosen, when the Physical address is listed as 64 bits, I am really not sure. Maybe it makes the calculation of the number of levels easier :-). Regards, Pushkal
The released solution does not answer the maximum number of pages that can be allocated to the process assuming 10 entries for the process at each level.  I suppose it is 8 KB*10*10*10*10*10 = 800 MB ( a factor of 10 for each level ).
Hi Pushkal - Thank you for your detailed response. Did not know on how to interpret "" fit-in naturally"", I guess means next power of 2.
Yes, I believe so.  I mean it shall also be natural to calculation of the Address, given a certain offset if each entry was 8 bytes rather than 7.","Yes, I believe so.  I mean it shall also be natural to calculation of the Address, given a certain offset if each entry was 8 bytes rather than 7.",4,1

316,Possible Mod 8 Worksheet solution error: friction vs. normal comparison?,dynamics1-001,,social,"I believe there is a typo on page 3 of Module 8 Worksheet solution PDF. Under the section titled ""Check Case 1"" we calculate the value of 'f1' as 'f1 = 356N'. We then calculate the associated normal 'N1' as 'N1 = 889N' and finally we calculate that 'f1max' as 'f1max = 267N'. These all appear to be correct. The error comes next where the notes show the comparison of '267 < 889'. I believe this is wrong as it seems to compare friction 'f1max = 267N' against normal 'N1 = 889N' rather than friction 'f1' against friction 'f1max'. I believe the comparison should be '267 < 356' not '267 < 889'. The final result (""block1 must slide relative to block 2"") is the same regardless so no overall harm done. But the problem solution is pretty detailed and the given comparison stumps me if it is correct as written: Why are we comparing a friction force against a normal force to determine sliding behavior? Shouldn't it be a comparison of a calculated friction force against a maximum friction force?",,1,0
317,Week6 Question 2,dynamics1-001,,resolves,"I am unable to picture the problem well. As such, I would like to clarify the following a)Is the spring always parallel to the inclined surface? b ) What exactly is the function of the cord wrapped around the hub. ? c) it would appear the spring comes into action only after the roller has rolled 1 feet downhill. I am trying my best to visualize the situation. Any help would be #URLREFicularly a odel of the problem in any instant when the spring is in a stretched position ( as opposed to its coiled rm as shown in the figure..
I have the same problem on clarity. They talk about radius of gyration, that would indicate that the mass is not in its centre C! And later in the problem they want to know how much the mass centre C is moved.... that to me seems like a contradiction..... any comment from the staff would be welcome.

When the cylinder is released, the spring is partially coiled because its natural unstretched length is greater than the distance to the top of the slope. Once the cylinder has rolled enough down the slope, the spring will be parallel to the slope and begin to act. As it stretches, it will slow down the cylinder until it stops.
Think of what happens to the cord wrapped around the drum as the cylinder rolles down.","

318,Modulus 42 Worksheet,dynamics1-001,,resolves,"For part b of this problem, I have 2 questions about the kinetic diagram: 1. Since we are taking the moments about point A, should we have modified the moment of inertia by the parallel axis theorem? 2. Is the sign incorrect on the inertia term since the rotation is clockwise? 
I didn't understand that relation (at part a of the problem) between the displacement of center and the force, it says ""if the center raises 2 ft, the force P raises 4 ft"". Can anyone explain that relation?
Imagine the center rises by 2 ft.And If the ropes stay put there will be a slack of 2 ft on either side of the pulley. To take up the slack the free end on which the force is applied should move 4 ft upwards. Really the 2 instances occur simultaneously but for simplicity we count the rise of the pulley then imagine that this contributes to a slack of 2ft on eithrer side (total o4 ft)and hence the free end of the rope around the pulley need to be pulled up by 4 ft.

The two equations are then simply combined as-is to yield the final equation: But this results in mismatched dimensions: we're adding force terms and moment terms together. Shouldn't the linear I-M equation be multiplied by a moment arm before combining it with the angular I-M equation? This in fact is done in the subsequent example problem; i.e., the force and linear momentum terms are multiplied by a moment arm. Aside from that apparent inconsistency, given that the linear and angular I-M equations must each hold, is there any real advantage to combining them into one equation rather than treating them as separate simultaneous equations?",,1,0

325,Module 20 question about acceleration of pont of contact,dynamics1-001,,resolves,"In this video we've walked through derivation of acceleration of that point of the wheel which is in contact with the surface. Ok, it's clear, that velocity of this point is zero. Next, we end up with nonzero acceleration of this point, and this is very strange, cause i can't understand how the derivative of zero can be something other then zero?
 Without going into the mathematics, think about it this way: we know that, at the precise moment of this snapshot, that point's velocity is zero. If its acceleration also happened to be zero, it would mean that, in the next moment, the point would continue to have zero velocity, and in the next after that, etc. There would be no motion. 
Dear Alexey. Imagine, tha you hold a mass in your hand #MATH This acceleration is the derivative of the zero velocity!
Ok, i can imagine it, but how it can be mathematically that the derivative of zero velocity is nonzero? Why in case with point C (center of the wheel) we can take derivative of velocity and get it's acceleration but in the case of point of contact derivative don't give us right answer? Cause point C is moving rectilinear? This is why we can get acceleration of pont C directly from derivative of it's velocity? 
 In these pictures I ivestigated the velocity and the acceleration of different points of a weel, moving with constant velocity. See the case at Lambde=1, when y=0, that is the point I, and at that point a vertical acceleration will insure the given path... 
 I'd like to rewrite the final equations, explaining the meaning of the terms:

328,How to deal with unfamiliar units,dynamics1-001,,elaborates,"Hi, since I believe that many students, including me, are quite unfamiliar with units like feet, lb, mile, etc. and prefer to use units like meter, km, kg. Could you please add data of this form in parentheses, please? That would save us much trouble 
I agree. But as long as it remains like this, you can try to search like ""0.3 slugs to kg""in Google. 
 There are Convert units applications for phones, tablets and windows 8. Use it for recalculating the units. It is a good practice! 
I looked up these units and since we do specify SI units for the metric system, can we expect one of the most popular English systems will be chosen, i.e., EE, English Engineering system or BG, British Gravitational system?
While I agree that SI units are easier to work with (I have a BS in Physics), still feel it's good practice to learn how to do calculations in a way that are agnostic with respect to the units. I will admit that it's frustrating, but I find that ""thinking"" about the problem in metric, but using feet/slug/pounds/etc.. with the appropriate constants in place of M/kg/N ends up working just fine.
Hi, Would you check my unit conversion, please? Â½ Ã 2 lb Ã #MATHÂ² = 0.1382 N-lm But 1 ft-lb = 1.35575 N-m Thanks! 
 I am an Indian, and in India we follow the metric system, as such. I used to have some difficulty navigating through the units, and thought of converting ft to m and mile to km, etc. But then 1 J = 1 Kg * #MATH As for uncommon units like slugs, stones etc. convert them to the base imperial unit, i.e. pound and you should be all good. My suggestion is don't bother to convert between imperial to metric and vice versa as you'll waste a lot of time. Just convert all units to the base units of the system being used. Rest is up to you. Cheers :D 
I found the following online while trying to solve P3 in W2. It came from #URLREF~dsimanek/scenario/errorman/#URLREF which turned out to be a great all-around reference for all types of unit conversions: Thought it may be useful.
The force in English unit will always confuse SI Unit users, Newton equivalent to Pound, then how to describe Mass in English unit ? mean Pound divide by g in English unit? by reading this article, #URLREF#URLREF(mass) 
English system is only used in the USA and the rest of the world uses Metric (its neighboring Canada has already been using metric for a very long time). But since our instructor is an American person of an American institution, I guess we have no choice but to deal with it in deference to the culture and way of life of the Americans. There is already a silent move towards metrication of the USA, especially in the academe, but it might take some time before everyone accepts and gets used to the system as most of the machines used in the USA today are still using English. 
How can it harm someone to know another system? The reason we learn the socalled English system is because it is used here. The academics dont build the bridges, roads, buildings, and plants in this country. Those educated in the system go to work for the firms that do.","The force in English unit will always confuse SI Unit users, Newton equivalent to Pound, then how to describe Mass in English unit ? mean Pound divide by g in English unit? by reading this article, #URLREF#URLREF(mass)
