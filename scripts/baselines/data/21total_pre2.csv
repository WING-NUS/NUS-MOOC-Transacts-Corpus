While I haven't seen this come out yet it is a great idea. There is so much effort put into studying personal localities across the world I think it would be a fascinating read.

Or did the course start 2 weeks ago? Please clarify.

Would anyone be willing to receive my geology assignment (I can e-mail it to you), and then you can upload it...? Thanks!! 
 I can try for you. When I uploaded mine, it was very tedious uploading pics, it was very sloooow. Did you try uploading text only on first go round, then adding pics after? Anyway my email is kelliec@pacbell.net, what is yours? 
 Hi Michaela It occurs to me that YOU may not be able to earn Signature Track credit for the course if the assignment is uploaded by ME under my user name. I'd still be willing to do it, but this is something to consider.

I am doing it around the clock. I enclose the result of my quiz and it is very disappointing that you cant delay the time of doing the quiz. Please check in other courses and you'll find that there are courses with no time limit. What does it mean to you that time is passed? Are doing something with the results of the quiz so early in the course? It is the same result if you delay the time out. In any case student who started late are losing the chance to certificate.

8,The Mantle is not stable it has mental problems,amnhearth-002,1,"Hi - I played with some numbers. Please check me. I know the radius of earth = 6,400 km, frequency of rotation 1 rotation every 24 hours. From here I can calculate the earth acceleration because of rotation. R1=6,400 km =6.4*10^(6) m, f1=1 cycles/24 hours. acceleration = a = R1*W1^2 W1=2*Pi*f1 f1=1/24*3,600=1/86,400 = 1.16*10^(-5) 1/sec W1= 1.16*10^(-5) 1/sec*6.28=8.45*10^(-5) 1/sec W1^2=(8.45*10^(-5) 1/sec)^2=71*10^(-10) 1/(sec^2) a1=(6.4*10^(6) m)*(71*10^(-10) 1/(sec^2))=454*10^(-4)m/(sec^2) I know the radius of earth orbit = 150 *10^6 km=150*10^9 m frequency of rotation 1 rotation every 365 days from here I can calculate the earth orbit acceleration = 54*10^(-4)(m/(sec^2) OK Now I can see that on the poles there is only the orbit acceleration. In the equator inner side close to the sun there is 454-54=400 *10^(-4)(m/(sec^2) In the equator outer side apart from the sun there is 454+54=108*10^(-4)(m/(sec^2) OK Now look what is happening - On the poles there is a vertical gravitational force of 9.8 m/(sec^2) but perpendicular to this force there is the orbit acceleration at 54*10^(-4)(m/(sec^2) If you combine this 2 vectors you get a shift which is away from the sun. It means that if you drop a body on the poles it does not fall vertical but a little shift away from the sun. The rest calculation on the equator is obvious. Why that calculation for? Now think what will happen to miserable mantle flow who is looking for the poles - will he miss the target? This mantle will be very unstable and confused. zvika greenberg Haifa Israel",elaborates,

Paralog refers to duplicate copies of a gene in the genome of a species, in this case the mouse alpha globin chain gene and mouse beta globin chain gene can be thought of as paralogs of one another. Orthologs are genes that occurred due to speciation, so after the early globin chain gene duplicated into alpha chain and beta chain globin genes, the genes were found in different species. In this case, mouse, frog and chick alpha chain globin genes are orthologs of each other. Homolog is the all-encompassing term used to describe paralogs and orthologs.

So these (the bottom 4) are likely more closely evolutionarily related than these (top) 4 sequences and this can tell us the evolutionary history of a set of sequences that have been aligned."" Can you explain why this is? I would think that closer sequence alignment would indicate closer evolutionary history among the sequences.",resolves,"I think what is meant here is that the bottom 4 sequences are closely evolutionarily related to each other, and the top 4 sequences are closely related evolutionarily to each other.

Same problem",resolves,"Bootstrapping is a way of assigning confidence to a tree. Pseudoreplicates are created through an iterative resampling process. If you have a dataset (set of sequences in this case) of n sequences with m sites (bases or nucleotides), a number of resampled datasets are produced, and each site is sampled at random a number of times. These resampled datasets are used to produce a number of trees which are then all reconciled in order to produce one tree with confidence/bootstrap scores included. Generally, a good number of bootstraps is 500 - 1000 (depending on the time and computing power and size of dataset). A link that may help explain this further is: http://www.icp.ucl.ac.be/~opperd/private/bootstrap.html Hope this helps explain the concept further! Hi Eduard! See my post above for (hopefully) a bit more clarification. Many different random sampling patterns would be constructed, each containing the same sum as the length of the sequences. Eventually, after many runs of this process (500 in your case), you will be able to gain a statistical confidence for your tree."

Eventhough it already has a post relating this, it does not really seems to put the attention that this subject deserves. In lecture slides page 6: ""Synonymous substitutions are not exposed..."" I suggest that this information has to be changed. According to Chen (2010) (DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0013574) sSNPs are just as likely to be involved in disease mechanisms. The reason of this is really well explained in a Nature paper of 2011 by Sauna and Kimchi-Sarfaty (DOI:10.1038/nrg3051) where they describe 4 different reasons why exactly sSNPs might be as damaging as the nsSNPs. (short link for the paper: http://goo.gl/CFy1Sf , reasons really well summarized on page 686 Figure 1). Therefore, nowadays, to stating that ""Synonymous substitutions are not exposed to (strong) selective pressures since they donât result in a change to the protein sequence"" and to suggest that this type of method would bring a more reliable result, would be as we Brazilians call: ""a shot in the foot"".",resolves,

Organisms tend to use some codons more than others, and other organisms prefer different ones, even if they code for the same amino acid.This is known as codon bias.So, even synonymous changes can be under (weaker) selective pressure. Also, a non-synonymous mutation could have little to no impact on fitness, but might increase in frequency due to random drift. 
=""Is it write to argue that synonymous mutations may only occur in a balancing selection"" If I understood question correctly - no, it's not right. Synonymous mutations occur constantly, because they are under almost zero selection pressure.

Hello Wayne ! Thank you so much for your post ! I am on Windows 7 PRO 64 bits and I followed your instructions as for MAC OS Java, and as our Java interface is almost identical, it worked well ! However, when I ran WebACT, I get a screen that doesn't look at all like the example in the course pdf ! This is what I got when I tried the webACT application on my MAC mini also ! I tried a few display options but to no avail. I have a Dell Optiplex 9010, 16 GB RAM and a Nvidia Quadro 600 Video card, so I think I should have the specs to be able to run the application. Am I doing something wrong ? Probably something to do with the display configuration ? Thanks ! Ken :) 
Hi Ken, Your image looks like what I saw.  The example in the lab pdf is between humans and mice. A good deal distant in evolutionary terms. I think you did everything right. In the example in the lab, we are looking at organisms with the same ATCC identifier. Scroll right to around '892800' to get the view much like he had in the summary, post-lab discussion talk slides. I found depending on where I clicked on the screen I could toggle the color red or yellow. That is interesting adding the exception worked for you on Windows too. I had been told Java applets were still working on at least one person's updated Java on Windows. But maybe he spoke to soon. Since I have been advising people how to keep Proteopedia.org working, it is useful to know how many systems are affected and that the work around works there. Wayne",social,

Because I don't know yet, so my next question is where can I see the value of E of the last hit? Please see my snapshot below. That could be great if you can take the snapshot(s) to show me. Thank you. 
i also had trouble answering this weeks 1st question as in my graphical summary the last hit had a value of exactly zero ( see screenshots for search strategy and graphical summary) so I wonder if there is any variation in a.what the instructor does as on the pdf files of the lab , Existence: Extension ratio is 11:1 whereas my Blastp default is set at 10:1.

38,Not getting the same output as Lab pdf,bioinfomethods1-001,"1,2,5,6.","Hi, is there a possibility that after entering the same settings as written in the Lab 2 pdf one gets different output? In addition, few things are unclear (e.g. are we to turn on or off the low complexity filter?) After doing part 1 (BlastP) of Lab 2, my graphical display does not contain 100 hits, but only 55. Further, neither hit #55 or #100 have the E-value (suggested in Discussion video). Finally, when clicking Taxonomy reports, a new window opens with the message "" No valid taxids found in the alignment "". Does anyone see what am I doing wrong? 
I agree with your observations.  I don't see 100 hits displayed and the E value is 0.  Also no valid taxonomy report... >>> Professor and staff:  This could be a really great course, but for beginners, it is >>> extremely important<<< that the lab document matches >>>exactly<<< with the output from the programs!  I know that the program can change and it can be very boring and tedious to make the lab document match up, but in order for beginners to learn and gain confidence in the material, and not give up because of frustration and confusion, it has to be WYSIWYG!  Please make this happen.  This could be the best bioinformatics course yet offered by Coursera, with great information, but the lab has got to work.  Thank you. 

I also agree. the graphical output is not presenting 100 sequences. one way to do this is to ''select all'' outputs from the table below, and click on ''graphics'' next to ''download'' link.
Not only for beginners, in the moment i match the answer in the lab quizz, at least the hit number 100 which is the most closely number that i found in the optional answers, it is wrong. The query input has been update almost a month ago, so maybe there are many things that must be need change. I hope the staff can help us... Edit1: After tried 10 times, clear all my historial, cookies and cache. Finally the Taxonomy report appear. Just be patients courserian partners...
I would keep trying on the taxonomy report. The first 2 times I tried the Taxonomy report is wasn't available.

Sometimes, if there are a lot of people using a particular tool at the same time, the program may slow down temporarily. If you keep trying, you will eventually get a result! Also, while we do try our best to keep the labs, quizzes etc. as up-to-date as possible, these databases are updated frequently and user interfaces also change frequently. As a result, it is not always possible to have the most up-to-date results/interfaces in the videos or lab documents. Nevertheless, you should be able to gain an understanding of the concepts by doing the labs and watching the lectures. Additionally, in the screenshot shown above, I don't think the ""Low complexity regions"" was checked, but in the lab it has instructed you to check this. Hope that helps! Hi Andyk! Yes I am seeing the result you mentioned, The database has recently been updated it seems. If you keep going down a couple of rows past that first non-zero value, you should see a value that is included in the answers.

Hi! From what I understood from lectures, CDMA is a only the access method for cellular network communications. It exists in both 1G, 2G and 3G, changing only the standard and algorithms used for band usage optimization (lika TPC or DPC). These algorithms can optimize power and control interference so the better the algorithm the higher the number of mobile stations it can handle inside a cell (I think I got this right but not sure...). In relation to 2G /3G overlay It is possible, because there are diferente mobile devices supporting just 2G or already 3G and 4G functioning inside the same areas.

The Hubbert Curve used to predict peak oil (or other resources) is actually a derivative of the logistic curve (also S-curve or sigmoid function), not a Gaussian curve as stated in the lecture.

There is a great explanation and examples at this link: http://www.billharlan.com/papers/logistic/logistic.html

The fact that there's only a coriolis force in 1 dimension arises from the fact that Earth only has 1 n/s rotation axis.Hi James, I stand corrected.

Are there modeling tools we can avail of? It seems this gas could be an important contributing GHG? I would certainly like some depth in discussing this gas versus CO2 for comparison along with methane and H20.",elaborates,"Hi Jim, I don't know a whole lot about N2O and its impacts on our climate (maybe others can weigh in here), but here's what I do know. N2O exists at a significantly lower concentration in our atmosphere than CO2 (300 ppb = 0.3 ppm for N2O vs 400 ppm for CO2; source ). The radiative forcing of N2O is significantly lower that of CO2 because of its lower concentration (0.1 W/m^2 for N2O vs 1.8 W/m^2 for CO2; source ). We'll learn about radiative forcing later in this course. It is basically a measure of the total warming effect of one species of GHG in the atmosphere. My interpretation of this data: N2O matters, but not nearly as much as CO2 or methane (CH4).Hi Jim, The fact that we are emitting 57/8 = 7.125 times more CO2 than N2O every year does not imply that there is 7.125 times more CO2 in the atmosphere. In fact, there is ~1000 times more CO2 than N2O."
77,Feedback Q5: Model the Lapse Rate and Greenhouse Effect,globalwarming-002,1,"As I see it, while water vapor is a greenhouse gas, it doesn't have the same effect as CO2. I answered the questions and got a 4/5, missing Q5. That means that I don't understand what Q3 and Q4 are actually telling me with regards to feedback. As Q5 states as definition: ""A positive feedback is a consequence of global warming that leads to further warming, and a negative feedback is a consequence of global warming that lessens the amount of warming."" I tested using the model, leaving CO2 at 0, and changing the Lapse Rate from 0 to 5 K/km (moist adiabat) the to 10 K/km (dry adiabat) and got the following emission to space values: LR = 0 K/m^2: 227 W/m^2 LR = 5 K/km: 219 W/m^2 LR = 10 K/km: 223 W/m^2 This shows that water is indeed a GHG as the radiation is greater with a dry atmosphere than moist, less power is radiated. So, I then reset the model and checked the effect at the same LR steps but with set CO2 as follows: LR = 0 K/m^2, CO2 = 279 ppm: 227 W/m^2 LR = 5 K/m^2, CO2 = 279 ppm: 200 W/m^2 LR = 10 K/m^2, CO2 = 279 ppm: 191 W/m^2 To me, this indicates that while water vapor is a GHG, it's presense reduces the effect of CO2, the dry adiabat emissions are less than the moist's. That indicates to me that the feedback of the moist LR is negative, and as the LR at 5 is stated to be due to it being a moist adiabat, then the feedback of water vapor must also be negative by default. But as my answer to that effect was indicated as wrong, I'm bamboozled. As there was no check leaving CO2 at 0 ppm and changing LR as I did I feel that I am missing something obvious in teh lesson that the exercise is supposed to teach me.

Here are some comments in response what you wrote above that I think might help: Firstly, you don't need to use the model to answer #5 - we intended for you to be able to answer it based on the information given in the question and from what you learned by thinking about the previous questions. It is great, though, that you're using the model to investigate the claims we make in the question. As far as I know, the RRTM model doesn't let you change the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. You can change the lapse rate, and varying the amount of water vapor also changes the lapse rate, but your changing the lapse rate doesn't automatically change the amount of water vapor. So, it looks like you were only using the model to evaluate the lapse rate feedback, and not the water vapor feedback. Does this address your questions? Feel free to ask follow-up questions!Excellent! Yes, what you were describing initially, Teresa, might be called a positive correlation, increased LR means increased temperature, but not a positive feedback as you correctly identified. This is how I initially learned about feedbacks: You change a variable of the system (i.e. temperature) in some way. The system can then respond to amplify that change (positive feedback) or reduce that change (negative feedback)."

However, if I understand the lectures of week 2 properly, heat flows freely upward by convection to the height of the tropopause, and the radiation absorption properties of the lower atmosphere has no impact on the temperature profile and heat flow up to that level. So, it would seem, only CO2 near or above the skin layer is effective in raising the altitude and depressing the temperature of the skin. For CO2, this doesn't matter so much, because the CO2 concentration will be constant with altitude. But water (because it has condensed out) and methane (because it is destroyed by stratospheric OH, O, and O3) will have lower concentrations at high altitude than near the surface. So, it would seem, they are less effective as GHGs than might be thought at first from lab measurements. Is this analysis correct?
The GHGs near the surface radiate downwards and add to the surface energy budget. In the MODTRAN online model, you can test the effect of varying the GHG values by first setting the altitude to 0km and switch from ""looking down"" to ""looking up"". In the tropical setting the downward radiation is 348.23 W/M2 at 400ppm CO2 and 350.11 at 800Oppm CO2.

Once you get to the top if you want to stop the wagon it will take 2 more steps: decrease the force allowing the wagon to accelerate in a downhill direction until it stops, then reapply equal force to maintain the wagon in an inertial velocity of zero, otherwise your wagon will roll right back down the hill. I would understand 2 steps or 4 steps better than 3 steps to get to the top. You either want to reach it, or get there and stay there.
I have a question on Ramps part 4, the work it takes to move the wagon up and down a hill. Is it fair to say that you are also doing work on your body, putting energy into moving your body up the hill, which is also stored as gravitational potential energy? But going up the hill you put work into moving both you and the wagon, while going downhill the gravitational potential energy is supplying the energy for the work to move both you and the wagon down the hill? So up the hill uses your energy and down the hill uses the stored gravitational potential energy. I don't understand quite how the energy is transferred from the wagon to the person going down hill. Maybe if I pretend I am a rubber band and lowering the wagon down the hill so the wagon's potential energy is transferring to me, decreasing the wagon's potential energy until it is zero while increasing he rubber-band's potential energy to spring back. But as humans we can't store the energy transfer, it just makes us hotter. Would that be correct -ish?",resolves,
94,Why upward acceleration(as soon as the ball is thrown up) isn't considered? Falling balls - Part5,howthingswork1-002,1,"As I understand it, when the Professor throws the ball up, he applies a force on the ball. Since a force is being applied on the ball, it is accelerated up and the ball gets an initial velocity. My question is, why isn't acceleration due to the force applied by the Prof (i.e. acceleration in the upward direction) being considered or mentioned?  Hope I'm clear.
Acceleration = velocity increases in the direction you're going. Deceleration = velocity decreases in the direction you're going (slowing down as you run up the stairs, remember?). Therefore, the upward movement of the ball (due to the exertion of force on it) is NOT acceleration but deceleration.   (You might find skating part 4 helpful). 
And I'd like to add to what I wrote earlier: You wrote: "" Since a force is being applied on the ball, it is accelerated up and the ball gets an initial velocity"" and that's not the way I understood the order of things (obviously, I can be wrong): I think that the force applied on an object determines its velocity but doesn't necessarily (or at all?) determine its acceleration. The acceleration is determined by something else. I mean, if it was how you describe it, than dropping a ball from rest it would just stay there, motionless (we didn't apply a force on it). But it does move, More than that- it accelerates... due to gravity. Since acceleration is the *change* in velocity over time, I think it's impossible to conclude an object's direction of acceleration from its velocity. Rather, we need to look at the greater picture and measure the change in velocity: increasing or decreasing. Thanks for posting your question, Karthik. I don't know if what I wrote here is correct, I only shared my understanding on that issue, but I liked the challenge in thinking of your question :)
 You wrote ""Acceleration of an object depends on the Force experienced by the object and its mass"" but actually, it depends on the net force and mass. And don't forget that in addition to the force you exert on an object- no matter in what direction- gravity (another force, that is) is exerted on it as well. Not to mention other forces we ignore for now, such as air resistance. Acceleration due to the force applied by the professor isn't mentioned because we study the motion of the ball from the time it leaves professor's hand. At this time, the force that professor was applying does not exist anymore therefore it does not influence the ball's motion.
Yes, this makes a lot of sense.. The point from which we undertake the study of the ball's velocity and acceleration etc. might explain it. I saw in another thread where something about the impulse/momentum transferred were mentioned while discussing the ball's motion. I still would like to hear more on this question.

95,Work and canceling forces,howthingswork1-002,1,"So prof. Bloomfield mentions the support forces never cancel out since they act on different objects. Does that mean that weight of the wagon is the same as support force of the ramp (sidewalk) on the wagon? Otherwise the net force would not be zero and the wagon should be moving. The second questions is regarding the definition of work as force * distance. If I support a very heavy rock above my head, aren't I doing work since my muscles are contracting and I have to resist the downward force of the rock? By definition, since the rock does not move, I am not doing any work on it. 
",elaborates,"When a wagon is on a ramp, they exert support forces on one another. The wagon exerts a support force on the ramp and the ramp exerts a support force on the wagon. Like all support forces, they act perpendicular (at right angles) to the touching surfaces and are therefore not vertical. The ramp pushes the wagon up at angle and the wagon pushes in the opposite direction. Because those two forces are a Newton's third law pair, they are equal in amount but opposite in direction. Those two forces are indeed on different objects, so they can't possibly cancel on another. The wagon's weight, however, has no direct relationship with the support forces. That weight points directly downward. There are thus two forces acting on the wagon: (1) the ramp's for on the wagon, which points up at angle, and (2) the wagon's weight, which points downward. Those two forces on the wagon cannot cancel because they don't point in opposite directions. When you add two vector quantities that aren't pointing along the same axis, they can't sum to zero. In this case, the sum yields a residue downhill net force. The wagon accelerates downhill in response to that net force. As for holding a heavy rock motionless, you do no work on the rock. You are pushing up on the rock to support so that it doesn't fall, but it moves no distance in the direction of your force. The rock receives no energy from you and it's total energy doesn't change. It still has the same gravitational potential energy (its altitude is constant, after all) and it still has the same kinetic energy (its velocity is zero and staying zero). But while you aren't transferring energy to the rock, you are transforming energy within your body from one form (chemical potential energy) to another form (thermal energy). You are essentially burning your food calories in your muscles and turning that energy into thermal energy -- the energy associated with temperature. You get tired and hot as a result, even though no energy leaves your body (I'm neglecting thermal energy that flows as heat to your colder surroundings). Bottom line: people don't make good statues. A statue could hold the rock up forever without any energy issues at all. There would be no transfers between statue and the rock, and the statue and rock would each have a constant energy. Lou If the net force on an object is zero, then the net work on the object as it moves will be zero. But that doesn't mean that individual forces aren't doing work or negative work on the object. For example, if you and a friend are playing tug-o-war with a rope and the rope is moving horizontally at constant velocity toward you, then you are doing positive work on the rope and your friend is doing negative work on the rope. Your friend's work on the rope is equal in amount but negative as compared to your work on the rope. So the rope's energy isn't changing (zero net work done on it). Instead, the rope is acting as a conduit through which you do work on your friend. Another example: you lift a box straight up at constant velocity. You are doing work on the box (you push up as it moves up) and gravity is doing negative work on the box (gravity pulls down as it moves up). The net work done on the box is zero. The box is acting as a conduit through which you do work on gravity. But in this case, gravity is storing the work done on it -- as gravitational potential energy. Since the earth itself doesn't move significant as you store energy in gravity or take that energy out, it is reasonable to associate that stored gravitational potential energy with the box. We say that the box has more gravitational potential energy than it had before you lifted it [even though that energy is shared between the box and Earth]. So the work you did on the box is effectively owned by the box as gravitational potential energy. Lou"

I have a question below: Cycling the pedal turns the back wheel, also known as the power wheel. Assuming no-slip conditions, static friction on the ground pulls the back wheel, and thereby the whole bicycle, ahead. However, the front wheel experiences static friction that pulls it backwards. So, for there to be forward motion, the static friction at the back wheel must be larger than that at the front wheel?
Yes, I believe the static friction on the back wheel is larger than on the front wheel, because of the torque on the back wheel by your work on the pedal. I hope I say this correctly. 
 I think front and rear wheel experience almost the same static friction on the ground because they are under same condition (same material, roughness....) and exert half of the weigh to the ground (assume the CG is almost at the center between the two wheels.) As considering a slipping condition, a highly rotated rear wheel exerts a small friction on ground and makes the bicycle accelerates a little bit. As the same time, (same?) friction is exerted by the ground on front wheel and causes it rotates. what makes bicycle slow down is friction toque by wheel bearing and ground (e.g protrusion, sticking.....) 
I think the rear wheel must experience stronger friction than the front. How else will there be a horizontal force propelling the bicycle forward?
 The friction force from the ground on the front wheel ( a free wheel) only needs to be enough to give a torque to turn the wheel. This is not much of a force as can be demonstrated by lifting the wheel off the ground and turning it by hand. However, the force required to accelerate the cycle (and cyclist) forwards is much bigger, try pushing a cyclist who is not pedalling. This bigger force is the one exerted as static friction on the rear wheel. It needs to be big enough to accelerate the cycle plus cyclist, and overcome the friction on the front wheel. Cheers, Ken.

I believe he said, that is it usually a wasted form of energy. I took it to mean in a human, he was using himself as an example, thermal energy is usually a wasted form of energy. Since volcano, fire, and boiling water is also thermal energy.

Happy Learning. 
Hi, Yes, usually thermal energy can't be directly used in humans. But I guess I am a bit confused about what work means in the context of thermal energy. For example if thermal energy helps keep us warm (I am currently staying in a place where it snows) can we say that thermal energy has been put to use? Hi Prashanth, Thermal energy is usually (not always) considered as a  wasted form of energy in physics because we cannot ""recover"" it.

Again, the same question that I asked above, what defines whether thermal energy is being recovered or not? For example when we use heat to keep our body warm, aren't we kind of using the thermal energy?",elaborates,"In general, thermal energy is not nearly as useful as ordered forms of energy. For statistical reasons, ordered energy that has been ground into thermal (disordered) energy won't spontaneously turn back into ordered energy. Reordering that thermal energy will require consuming some other form of order. In an isolated system that is all at the same temperature, the thermal energy itself has no order available and none of it can become ordered energy without some external intervention [although there may be some other forms of order around that complicate the story]. However, if parts of that isolated system have different temperatures, there is order associated with those different temperatures and that order can be used to turn some of the thermal energy into ordered energy. That concept, in which a fraction of the heat flowing from a hotter thermal reservoir to a colder thermal reservoir is diverted and becomes useful work, is known as a heat engine. Basically, a heat engine uses the order in a two-temperature system to convert a portion of thermal energy into work while obeying Thermodynamics (mostly the 2nd law, or ""law of entropy""). In your cooking discussions, there are two temperatures: the hot oven and the cold food. There is order in that temperature difference and it is this order that allows all sorts of interesting things to happen as you cook. The food can change shape, make noise, undergo chemical changes, and so on, many of which involve ordered activities. The two-temperature situation provides the necessary order. Once everything is at the same temperature, the order is gone (at least the thermal energy portion of it) and not much new will happen. Lou The discipline is thermodynamics and statistical physics. Thermodynamics itself plays an important role in many areas of science and engineering. The modern issues of energy and power generation are deeply entwined with thermodynamics. Chemical engineering is just one of many fields that depend on thermodynamics. Nearly all the energy that goes into your home eventually becomes thermal energy. All of the electrical devices that are located entirely within your home, including your laptop, turns essentially 100% of the power it consumes into thermal power. Thus, if your laptop consumes 80 watts of electric power, it releases 80 watts of thermal power into your room. You can facilitate that flow of heat into your room by putting heat-exchanging fins or structures on your laptop, but it will still release the same amount of thermal power into the room in the long run. What will change, however, is the temperature of the laptop. The more efficiently it sends heat into the room, the lower the temperature at which it will reach that thermal balance (electric power in equal thermal power out). That's the value of heat sinks for CPU chips, etc. -- the heat sinks help heat flow into the room air and allow the CPU chip to reach balance (electric power in equals thermal power out) at a lower temperature (and safer temperature). Basically, if you don't mind your laptop getting fairly warm, don't worry about helping it release its heat into the room. It'll do that just fine and it was designed to reach balance without overheating. Lou"

The cannon shoots a ping pong ball into the air, which falls back into the mouth of the cannon a few yards down the track. It's a very impressive demo 
",elaborates,"In principle, at least, the dropped bullet and the horizontally-fired bullet will hit the ground simultaneously. The physics here is that the fired bullet is coasting horizontally at great speed, but its vertical motion is simply that of a falling object. Both bullets begin to fall at the same time and with the same initial ""vertical component of velocity"" -- the projection or portion of velocity that lies along the vertical axis. Both bullets accelerate downward at approximately 9.8 m/s2 and hit the ground simultaneously. We demonstrations like this frequently, but with balls instead of bullets. There are demonstration tools that drop two balls at once; one ball simply falls, while the other ball is shot horizontally by a spring. The two balls really do hit at the same time. The bullet-version would be dramatic and fun, but it would require a huge open space and complicated equipment to show both bullets hitting -- after all, they hit the ground at very different locations. [One final note: this story neglects air resistance, which will cause small discrepancies in the fall times, and it also neglects the curvature of the Earth. If the bullet is fired at too great a speed, it will go into orbit!] Lou Nice! I've never seen that demonstration done with a real gun before. What an amazing job they did setting it up and running it. Lou"
104,Necessity of thumb rule for specifying direction of rotation?,howthingswork1-002,1,"Hi, In week 4, Dr.Bloomfield talks about the need of thumb rules for specifying directions of rotation. For eg: The right hand thumb rule (see  episode 4 part 1). I understand that and agree with it. But why not just use positive and negative angles (based on which side rotation occurs) and specify the axis like x-axis, y-axis or z-axis. I have used this sometimes in mathematics courses and I wonder why can't we just use these notations to specify direction of rotation?",elaborates,
105,Falling Balls Part 3: Earth lb versus Moon lb,howthingswork1-002,"1,2.","We were told a lb on the Moon is less than a lb on Earth. Wouldn't the measures be relative to the place we are weighing? Would there be a earth lb to moon lb conversion factor? That would mean we would need a local reference for the weight stated on a package - per the example (1 Earth lb or 1 Moon lb.)
The gravitational force on earth is about 6 times more than that on the moon. So I would think that a lb on Moon is about 6 times less than that on Earth. As we have heard in lectures, the gravitational acceleration is not exactly same on all parts of the earth, and I would expect the same on the moon too.  But for most of the common purposes the gravitational acceleration can be considered constant. So I would say 1 Earth lb = 6 Moon lb. As for the statement on the package, a lb is not universal. Stating the mass (kg) on the packet would be a better way.
On earth a kg has weight 2.2 pounds force. Louis B is saying that on the moon a kg has weight of 2.2 / 6 pounds force. The relativity problem would come in if we weighed with weights on a scale. If we used a spring scale, for example, it wouldn't come in.",elaborates,
106,what is the differences between weight and mass ?,howthingswork1-002,2,"Today, professor said Mass is the measure of an object's inertia at lesson 3 in falling balls and weight is relate to gravity but mass doesn't. actually, In my life, I don't care whether stuff have weight or mass. so I've not understood differences of those concept. Please explain me easily. 
The weight is really the force that pulls the object to the surface of the earth. That force on the object gets greater and greater as we go up. That's why, if you drop your laptop from the top of a huge building, the laptop will suffer more damage than when you drop it 1 or 2 meters above the ground; there is a greater force acting on the laptop when it's higher above the ground. That force= weight . The mass is really just the kilogram or pounds of the object. If your laptop has a mass of 10kg, it remains the same wherever you go: at the top of the Eiffel tower, in the lowest caves,...etc or even in space!  Hope this helps!",elaborates,
107,Why is the speed of a falling object increasing?,howthingswork1-002,1,"The gravity force are constant. But why the object what is falling down is increasing in speed?
Hi johann. In NewtonÂ´s first law: An object that is at rest will stay at rest unless an external force acts upon it. An object that is in motion will not change its velocity unless an external force acts upon it. In that case gravity force is acting over the object during all way long (not only at the start), this is the reason of the aceleration. I hope this answer help you. 
",resolves,"Since falling occurs so quickly, it's hard to see the increasing speed of a falling object. You know instinctively that the speed continues to increase because you are more concerned about being hit by a falling apple that has dropped 10 meters than one that has dropped 1 meter. However, I suggest you watch Galileo's experiment: let a ball roll down a slightly tipped ramp. The physics is very similar to falling, but it occurs much more slowly. Watch how the ball's speed increases steadily as it descends. The ball is experiencing a constant downhill force and is accelerating downhill at a constant rate. As a result, its speed increases steadily. After all, acceleration is the rate at which velocity is changing with time. Lou That's a great question! The 10-kg ball in your photograph is much more difficult to accelerate than 1-kg ball. If they had equal weights, the 10-kg ball would accelerate more slowly than the 1-kg ball and lag behind. However, the two balls don't have the equal weights! The 10-kg ball weighs 10 times as much as the 1-kg. That's a remarkable result -- the force that gravity exerts on an object is exactly proportional to that object's mass. As a result, the 10-kg ball exactly keeps up with the 1-kg ball. The two balls accelerate at the same rate and fall together perfectly (neglecting air resistance). Lou"
108,Skating Part 1 - Why doesn't a slow knife cut the apple?,howthingswork1-002,1,"When doing the table cloth/apple cut ""tricks"", why does the cloth/knife have to be executed quickly?  Why would slowly removing the table cloth or cutting with the knife effect the object's inertial tendency to remain still more than doing it quickly? 
",elaborates,"Even though it is very sharp, the knife pushes a little bit on the apple. With enough time, that push will cause the apple to start moving fast enough to spoil the cutting process. By moving the knife as fast as I can, I limit the time over which the knife pushes on the apple and allow the apple's inertia to dominate the situation. The knife then succeeds in cutting the apple. The same is true for the tablecloth and dishes. There is a small frictional force on the dishes as the tablecloth moves underneath them. If I go to slow, that frictional force will get the dishes moving and they'll leave the table. By going fast, I minimize this nuisance effect and leave the dishes behind. Lou Gravity plays only a tiny roll in my knife-cuts-the-apple demonstration. If gravity were absent, the apple would have been hovering motionless above the aluminum plate, but the knife would have sliced through it just the same. The apple remained essentially in place because of inertia. If I were a better swordsman, I could slice the apple as fell and I could slice it in any direction -- up, down, sideways. If gravity were helping during an upward slice, it wouldn't be helping during a downward slice. Nonetheless, I could certainly slice it anyway. Don't hold your breath for hoverboards... it would be nice, but I'm not expecting to see them (alas). Lou

(If not, why is the box not doing positive work on the table, while it is doing negative work on the box?) I  am guessing that the momentum is conserved, but completely masked by all the other physics Professors who crash their wagons at the same time onto their tables at different angels (and other interactions)..... or in other words that to observe the conservation of motion is only possible when looking at an isolated system. But at a microscopic level: if friction transforms the kinetic energy of the box into unusable heat energy, is the overall directional component of the momentum still conserved in the erratic heat movements?

112,Some examples of marriages movies,marriageandmovies-001,1,"I was thinking in The appartment with Jane Fonda and Robert Redford and Memories with Barbra Strisand and Robert Redford. Could be considered as examples of marriage films??
I haven't seen those. How about these examples. Are these marriage movies? - the green card http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099699/ - 4 weddings and a funeral http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109831/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 - the proposal http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1041829/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_9 - while you were sleeping http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114924/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_33 As said in the lectures, it's mostly about the chase for a partner in the movies, not the marriage it self. 
Is ""Breaking the waves"" by Lars von Trier a marriage movie? I think so, because the story wouldn't be the same, if the protagonists were not married.
Hi Anna, I think ""Breaking the Waves"" is a very interesting movie and that it ""qualifies"" as a marriage movie, yes, even if it is a really crazy one! Iâm not sure if anyone brought up this film to the discussion already but I think âBefore Midnightâ (2013) is the perfect example of a marriage movie in recent years. Not just because it is the case that the movie wouldnât function in any way without the central couple but also because it resolves one of the problems Jeanine talked about in one of the first lectures: the problem of a marriage being a subject that takes a long period of time to develop. As you know, âBefore Midnightâ is the third movie of the Linklater trilogy about the relationship of Jesse and Celine â being the first one, âBefore Sunriseâ (1995), about falling in love, the second one, âBofore Sunsetâ (2004), about the reencounter, and, finally, âBefore Midnightâ, specially focused on the aspects of a long-term relationship. I just love this film and think that the director made an excellent and subtle job showing what changes and what the challenges are for people when they decide to stay together. 
Brief Encounters is a film that will be discussed in the 3rd week. It is an excellent film story by Noel Coward. What I like about it is that it involves emotional infidelity but not in the usual way films have it. I.e., with the married person having a spouse who is insufferable or an idiot. That is such an easy rationalization for stepping outside the marriage. But in Brief Encounters, the spouse being left at home is simply not the same as the other guy and so the woman develops a strong desire for a different person. Well at least that makes for a more complicated and perhaps realisitic story to tell and Coward's screenplay handles it extremely well. 
When Anthony said ""Brief Encounters"" I thought ""Close Encounters (of the Third Kind)"", and it made perfect sense to me. It took me a while to realyse the misunderstanding. I didn't see the movie ""Brief Encounter"" yet but now I'm very curious about it. At first it seemed very difficult to think of a ""marriage film"" but know they keep popping up in my mind. Thinking about ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (a film I really don't like), at the surface it seems like a sci-fi movie but it's actually about a guy that feels bored with he's family and wants to experience something knew, to encounter someone who shares his point of view. Not the aliens! but the other woman with whom he feels useful and at home. Does it sound too far-fetched?
 Does Gaspar Noe's 'Irreversible' count as a marriage movie? If it does, it must be one of the most disturbing ones ever. It's interesting that the two main actors in it, Vincent Cassell and Monica Bellucci, are married in real life too. 
My example of a Marriage Movie would be ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" with Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie. It does have excitement, true, but the marriage is what makes the movie. If the characters were not married then it would be any other cookie-cutter action movie.
 I would class the 1968 film 'The Lion in Winter' as largely a marriage movie. Although its context is the politics of Henry II's 12th century court and especially those of his bickering family, at the very centre of the film is the turbulent marriage of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, as played out in all its drama and comedy during a Christmas court. These central characters have been married long and we learn of their many traumas and battles with each other over the years, which still continue, and yet somehow they remain oddly a couple who have genuine affection for each other. Although this is a historical and royal setting, there are elements in this marriage which must surely resonate with contemporary audiences.",elaborates,"Haven't thought about ""Close Encounters"" in a long time, but your description of the couple's relationship rings a bell. I wonder about other classic ""genre"" films (SciFi, horror, suspense, crime, historical/biopic, etc) that are also about marriages, especially marriages where something goes very wrong: ""Poltergeist"" ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" ""The Incredible Shrinking Woman"" ""Gaslight"" ""The Shining"" ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" ""The Godfather"" ""The Sopranos"" (TV) Come to think of it, ""Orson Welles and Marriage"" might be a master's thesis for someone, if it hasn't been already, perhaps many times over... -- ""Citizen Kane"" -- ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" -- ""The Stranger"" ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (like Kane, has this film been watched and written about too much to be part of our category?) ""Superhero Marriages"" could be another multimedia dissertation for someone... Or a lighthearted essay... Or a self-help best-seller... ""The Incredibles"" ""Lois and Clark"" (TV series) ""The Fantastic Four"" ""Mad Men"" (thinking of Don Draper as a superantihero -- secret identity, power to cloud men's minds, etc.) Pardon my ADHD and whimsy... Bob in Virginia  Even the marketing of the film appears to agree, as shown in the image at the right from a film trailer, via the Nick & Nora Charles Wikipedia page . And then there's the dog... I see someone has a Thin-Man-series ""I Love Asta"" website . I agree wholeheartedly with a comment there: "" Audiences today can't help but envy Nick & Nora Charles, and what's not to love?

Two recent ones about marriage I enjoyed: Amour (2012; French) & Fill the Void (2013; Israel).
gotta see those two! Hi, I would recommend the spanish movie ""Take my Eyes"" (Iciar BollaÃ­n, 2003). It is a marriage film about domestic violence, psychological and physical abuse and its impact in everyone in the family. A powerful film, very realistic and brutally honest. Trailer I MDB Available on Netflix. If is not in her list yet, I think is a must see for Mrs. Jeanine. 
 I liked a Swedish film called ""Scenes of a Marriage"" by Ingmar Bergman which was introduced to me from the ""Scandinavian Film and Television"" course and a Korean film called ""Marriage is a Crazy Thing"" by Yoo Ha! There is adultery in both films but the ordinary marriage life bits are well depicted too! 
The first foreign marriage movie that came to my mind was Chalte Chalte 2003 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346723/plotsummary I remember seeing it a few years back and being amazed because most movies I remember seeing were more about chasing the girl than seeing the couple after the marriage. The movie confirms the 7 sins as it is about class difference and money issues. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248126/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl is also MM imho. It's about a couple getting married without the (richer) parent consent of the groom. This movie deals with class difference and non acceptance of the in-laws of their new daughter in-law and resulting loneliness and estrangement for everyone involved. So again this movie reaffirms the 7 sins (horrible in-laws, class differences) 
 I watched a French film last night titled ""La Doublure"" (in English "" the Valet.). My husband thought it was a marriage movie and I was looking for the 7 problem areas. The problems were infidelity and money (too much and too little), but it was not really a marriage movie at all. It did have 2 marriages in it, but neither was the central theme. 
 We have watched another French film that's a perfect example of a marriage movie where the situation exacerbates the differences in the couple. The movie is ""The Women on the 6th Floor."" The husband is a quiet, non- expressive man and his wife is uptight and neurotic. There's clearly no joy in this long term marriage, just boredom. This all changes when a group of ""sassy Spanish maids"" move into the couple's building 2 stories up. The husband is curious about these women and their zest for life and he is slowly drawn into their world as a great friend. The wife doesn't understand the situation at all and, I think, just thinks her boring husband has lost his mind. He's having the time of his life and finding real joy. This movie is a joy worth watching and illustrates an odd couple and also a situation that is very important.

114,Suspicion: The Controversial Ending.,marriageandmovies-001,1,"Mrs Basinger alluded to the ending of ""Suspicion"", and how it tends to provoke strong responses. What do you think....Was Johnnie intending homicide or suicide? I always struggle with the ending of this movie- Either way, it seems to me, at the very least, Lina should have some serious doubts about the future of the relationship. Her assertion they will ""See it all through"" seems so odd given how tumultuous the film presents. But it is Cary Grant after all. That face could cover a multitude of sins. ;) Another aside - A couple of years ago I found this link to the original ending. It's fun to remember that sometimes the film's final product isn't the original perspective. Would love to hear what you think of this alternative: http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~muffin/suspicion_c..html 
The last few minutes of the film are gripping. Both endings show Hitchcock messing with us. I love it! I am reminded of when, as an American student in Paris in the late 1960s, I came out of a French film with some French classmates and expressed my consternation that the ending was unresolved. ""But what happens next?"" I whined. The shocking, chuckled response: ""Nothing, of course. The film is over.""
My first impression is homicide because that would be in line with the story and his character. I think Hitchcock did his job well and left us to choose....if you're hopelessly in love and positive you will choose suicide. I can't imagine why the woman stayed with Johny. She had so many reasons to doubt him and distrust him, and still, she's staying. He staged everything well. They return home, he gained trust with her and she's going to fall into his trap. Great suspence.
This is one of many Hitchcock masterpieces--If I were her I would have left--alternatively; she is so relieved that she forgives all and discounts her previous doubts and stays to make a go of the marriage. Regardless of how you feel it is a good entertaining film. 
The IMDb states in its Trivia on ""Suspicion"" : "" Alfred Hitchcock originally wanted Johnnie to be guilty, but the studio insisted that the public wouldn't accept Cary Grant as a murderer. Hitchcock's original ending had Johnny killing Lina by poisoning her milk, but then convicting himself by mailing a letter that Lina had written. Joan Fontaine said, Cary Grant ""did kill me in the original cut, but at a preview, the audience simply refused to accept him as the murderer."" 
Did Hitchcock do his walk-on in this movie? If he did, I didn't recognize him. The ending left me suspicious. I believe he really intended to kill her, but decided to wait for a more opportune time. Cary Grant was a very romantic and lovable scoundrel. Monkey-face was afraid of the dreaded ""spinster"" word, or worse yet ""old maid"" stigma for women of that time. She married the first man who asked her, and what a debonnaire and diabolical catch he was. Her paranoia from the first meeting was justified. I wish she could have relaxed and enjoyed his attention for a little while anyway. 
Was that a Picasso that the inspector did double-takes rubbernecking on his entry and exit from their home when the two cops came to investigate Twiney's death? I think it was. I kept expecting it to play some part in the story, other than just being part of the decor, and photographed so obviously in that scene; but, no, it was just emphasized.

115,The OWI: Use of Hollywood for Propaganda,marriageandmovies-001,1,"I'm running a bit behind so didn't get to post this during week 4. Just watched Week 4 Lecture 2 and this topic resonated strongly with me. I have been aware of the way that films were used to persuade the public that certain behaviors or value systems or beliefs were ""right"". The situations, the characters, and the events are often carefully designed to push a particular agenda. I had not been aware until this lecture that the effort was overt. Rather than reflecting the current opinions, filmmakers were specifically tasked to shape those opinions. In SINCE YOU WENT AWAY I noticed that the only person who thought the war was a bad thing, the Agnes Moorhead character, was totally unlikable; she was a hoarder (EVIL!), a nosy pest (IRRITATING!), and insensitive to the needs and feelings of those around her (MEAN! NASTY!). Naturally when she asserted that there was altogether too much flag-waving, everyone, both the movie characters and the audience, hated her and thought she was a horrible person for saying that. On the eve of one of America's three ""War Holidays"" it seems appropriate to examine our attitudes toward the military. Today the lines between entertainment and news, between truth and fiction, between reality and fantasy, have blurred. We are more likely to see truth in the context of movie than in the nightly news, because some few filmmakers still enjoy challenging the system but virtually all ""news"" shows must toe the corporocratic line. I'm sure the Office of War Information was dissolved soon after World War 2. Did its function continue? Is there a similarly overt pressure imposed on Hollywood today to push the assorted government agendas relevant to our times (e.g. terrorists are everywhere and the feds need to spy on you for your own safety, countries around the world need our military intervention so that they can be free, etc.). I'd thought the pressure was less direct than having an agency specifically tasked to guide the media in ""acceptable"" directions, but if we had an OWI to oversee the dissemination of information in the 1940 it's no stretch of the imagination to think there is an equivalent today.",elaborates,

The first that came to my mind was Ingmar Bergman's ""Scenes From a Marriage"" (1973) but that was a TV Mini-series and not a movie. A few other titles come to mind in which marriage is in a crisis, such as "" The Story of Us"" (1999), ""Hope Springs"" (2012) and ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" (1966).

 Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) Bridges of Madison County (1999) Hope Springs (2012) I think these are beautiful examples of the trials and tribulations of marriage and of the impecable performance of Merryl Streep. 
What about the movie ""Revolutionary Road(2008)"" directed by Sam Mendes? It seems about the essence of life in which marriage is inevitable and plays an important role. 
I was thinking of Zhang Yimou ""To live"" (1994). A wonderful story of a couple who manages to remain together and raise a family, ""to live,"" through very dramatic times. Another example is "" The best intentions"" by Bille August, script by Ingmar Bergman, in which it is told the story of the marriage of the parents of Bergman.

So I started thinking about it. It's certainly not strictly a marriage movie, more like film noir, but I was thinking about Professor Basinger's question as to whether the plot hinged on the characters being married or not. I think in this case, it absolutely does. In what other situation besides marriage could Charles Boyer have exercised that kind of power over Ingrid Bergman (unless he was another member of her family, a father or a brother)? The two of them have to live in the same house and she has to trust him enough to do what he wants and believe what he says. I don't think the film would be as suspenseful as it is if they were merely two people living together, even if he did know about her aunt's murder and carried out all the same actions. The fact that he is her husband makes the events of the film more potent and horrifying--it makes it even harder for her to get away, and because he's her husband it doesn't occur to her that he is the instigator, so she blames her own mind. Thoughts, anyone? Anne",elaborates,"Interesting case.

Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are definitely a modern day movie couple in the classical sense, although they have not worked together of late. Some movie couples from yesteryear might include: Hepburn and Tracy Rogers and Astaire Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland William Powell and Myrna Loy (even beyond the Thin Man movies) 
 I enjoy Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan together. They both are sweet & ""have goodness"" in them. I wonder if there are any movies made, from 1940s to present that show how couples handle the doldrums of marriage? The woman busy with cooking, cleaning, & raising children, husband busy with career & how they put the magic back into their marriage as the boredom sets & they realize what they will be losing??? 
 From TV how about Rob and Laura Petrie from the Dick Van Dyke show? Or even earlier Margaret and Jim Anderson from Father Knows Best? I thought both these couples were very realistic in the way they related to each other. 
Debbie Reynolds and Tony Randolph Doris day and David Nevin Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher
Reynolds & Fisher were married--Carry Fisher (Star Wars=Princess Leia their daughter) Liz Taylor and Richard Burton Doris Day and Rock Hudson Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie Woody Allen and Dianne Keaton 
One married couple from television that I thought showed real chemistry when they were working together was Bill Cosby and Phylicia RashÄd from ""The Cosby Show"". 
The African Queen. They are not married, although very much like a marriage.
I'm not sure I would classify The African Queen as a marriage movie. Yes Kate and Bogie bicker and fight and eventually reach a happy ending, but I think this is a romantic film with a subplot of war that leads to their marriage near the end of the movie.Romancing the Stone with Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas. They were just lovely in that movie and, I think, had the chemistry to make it believable. 
They continued the relationship in Jewel of the Nile",resolves,
122,Film 3: THE MARRYING KIND (Cukor 1952),marriageandmovies-001,2,"I liked this film much more then the last. It was more interesting but there was a moment that was a bit, that seemed never ending, and I had asked myself when will it end., jes seems like I am trapped. Similar to the characters in the film at the boys death and not able to cope(which is a common theme) some kid gets sick, dies, gets taken... Anyways I could(I have seen and heard Ruth Gordon in many films) notice a pattern of speech I had recognized in like Every Which Way but Lose Clint Eastwood film series and other movies she was in. Same way I can recognize a cadence in speech with David Mamet, Woody Allen, and even Quinton Tarantino. 
Is there a way to stream The Marrying Kind?

Just curious but was ""John"" every directors favorite name for leading males??? 
What's a ""MIL"" and ""DIL"" ?
MIL = mother in law Dil = daughter in law SIL = son in law  I enjoyed watching this movie, but it did remind me of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" throughout the movie. I guess it's just the James Stewart way of seeing the world. For the era it was portraying, it came across as believable.

126,just how wild are the orchids?,marriageandmovies-001,1,"Just as film allows audiences to experience luxury bathrooms and clothing vicariously, there is also the opportunity to safely contemplate crossing the boundaries of conventional relationships. In Wild Orchids, doesn't Garbo's character have a repulsion/attraction to the Prince's brute beating of a servant? She sees the beating, then recalls it when she sees him--is this a fantasy desire to be dominated? Initially he forces kisses on her, but later on, she kisses back. I was struck by how well she was able to communicate without dialog. In the clip that was part of the lecture, her disappointment at her husband's rejection of her Javanese outfit is so clear, from how her shoulders sag. . . We never learn how she came to be married to such a fuddy-duddy
",elaborates," You have a good point there when asking ""How she came to be married to such a fuddy-duddy?"". Do you think that is part of the structure Professor Basinger talked about in her lectures - that in the end audience wants to see marriage saved, no matter how passionless it seems to be? There is a great deal of passion in Lillie's relationship with the Prince, but in the end she proclaims her love for her husband although we haven't seen much of it in the course of the film. What do you think are the reasons for such ending? Is it a true happily-ever-after? And what can we deduce about the society's view on marriage in that era from this film, was passion important for them in marriage or something else?  There does seem to be a faintly S&M quality in Mrs. Sterling's relationship with the prince. As to her initially attraction to her husband, he's wealthy and older, so he's got sort of a ""father-figure"" appeal to him perhaps (?). As to the ending, my take on it is that Mr. Sterling's expression of love or jealousy or whatever it was that drove him to consider murdering the prince seems to have sparked a little something in both Mr and Mrs Sterling (which, if you think about it, is even more perverse than her seemingly getting turned on by the prince meting out a whipping) . . . the film seems to be making some sort of (quasi-Freudian) connection between hunting and virality--it makes a big deal out of Mr. Sterling's hunting gear not having made it on board with him, the prince offers to lend him a rifle, and it's only when he finally gets his hands on the gun that he is able to rekindle his relationship with his wife.

127,BioPics as marriage movies?,marriageandmovies-001,1," Many biographical films about a famous man or woman would probably qualify as marriage movies, since the marriage partner, and so the marriage, often plays a central role in the success of the lead character. For example, Coal Miner's Daughter wouldn't have been made without Mooney Lynn's (Tommy Lee Jones in the movie) role in making his wife Loretta Lynn's career. The Johnny Cash bio pic Walk the Line probably wouldn't have been made without June Carter Cash. Even the Iron Lady needed Dennis Thatcher. 
Good point. Actually Walk the Line was released in Brazil with the title ""Johnny and June"", focusing on the couple.
this is a good point, and a reason why defining the ""Marriage Movie"" is so complicated. Marriage being such a powerful social construct means that the BioPic is most often going to deal in some way with Marriage or Marriages in the case of Johnny, I keep thinking of something like Giant, where the marriage is not the cause of the drama but it is the constant and over lying theme. Is Family Drama another category?

The caption reads: ""The year was 1964. Photographs in newspapers across the United States revealed a terrible truth--the land of the free was a battlefield scarred by deeply rooted racial inequality. Amid these headlines, Andy Warhol produced a series of works depicting an attack on civil rights protesters in Birmingham, Alabama. Fifty years later, these groundbreaking works exemplify Warhol;s ability to create art that defined an era.""

I do not agree that the ubiquitous repetition of Marilyn Monroe's face signifies death. Since each repetition is different but subtle I feel that there is a quality of alivness to the pictures..

131,The Rolling Stones Andy Warhol Zippers and Sticky Fingers,warhol-001,1,"The 1970s witnessed a flood of open sexuality - post-Stonewall riot, birth of disco, Transcendental Meditation and Swinger's clubs are all coming signs of the sexual revolution. Sex, or rather, the more open attitude about it was everywhere. Warhol, a quiet, conservative Catholic homosexual must have had a sigh of relief - after having fully recovered from an assassination attempt (by Valerie Solanas) he surrounded himself with me and began to feverishly create works that walks the line between art and pornography. When asked to create the cover and concept for the Rolling Stones' ""Sticky Fingers"" album Warhol was quick to capitalize on the sexual allure of lead singer Mick Jagger (The image is NOT of Jagger by the way) and Warhol's casual remark to Jagger that it would be interesting to have an album cover with a zipper on it. When you undid the belt buckle, white cotton underwear stamped with Andy Warhol was revealed (it also served to protect the vinyl from the real metal zipper). Gone is the playful innuendo of a large banana (from the Velvet Underground) finding in this work, Warhol flaunting his voyeuristic sexuality (a male with a rather large penis), his interest in combing art with mass consumption (the album would be one of the Rolling Stones' most successful), along with the continuation of his fascination with provoking the boring. Please upflag this post if you've read it or bought the album! 
This was such great album cover! I remember seeing it on display in a record store at the time, and would've have bought it if I'd had enough money. Unfortunately, the zippers caused serious problems in the distribution process, such as tearing the cellophane wrappers and catching on each other in stacks. Andy must have conceived this as an artwork on the wall, and not packed into cartons sitting on forklifts. 
Alice Thanks for reading and replying to my post (maybe give it an up flag?) I worked for years at a record store and saw hundreds of this album fly out the door. It was too bad that later reissues did away with the real zipper and cloth undies ...
Warhol did a quite few album covers including Love you live.According to: http://kingydesignhistory2012.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/kay-post-6-musicgraphics/ RCA Records hired Warhol, along with another freelance artist, Sid Maurer, to design album covers and promotional materials. I wonder who Mick is biting and why. The hand looks feminine. However, given their relationship, it might be Keith. Yes, I know, there is no skull ring or have I the wrong hand. The count Basie is a little tamer and nothing risque about Hugo Winterhalter album. Both I think would be early work. 
Darryl: Thanks for commenting on my thread and it shows how quick corporate America is quick to capitaliz on the usccessful. The Gershwin cover comes from a drawing Warhol did in the 50s - probably reflecting the age of the music. If I saw the Basie out of context, I might even be hard pressed to vote it a Warhol cover. As for the Stone - no doubt - and maybe the hand is the hand that feed you. :-)

132,Porn as art ?,warhol-001,1,"It seems to me that Warhol is treating pornography in the same way, essentially, as he treated Campbell's Soup, in that he's taken something that already existed commercially ( even if ""underground"") and made it into art by putting the Warhol stamp on it. ""Blow Job"" is, I think, interesting as it's not unlike the product of the underground porn studios of the time who tended to offer more than they delivered in terms of content. The same is true of ""Hollywood"". I remember the posters for the film ""Barbarella"" prominently stating that ""She strips in space"" ( I've no idea if she did or not, I've never seen it but I'm confident that it wouldn't have been the ""full monty"".). 
Barbarella never stripped (in film ) . Guess Warhol took what was a common way of thinking and turned it upside down . His movies are hard to find i guess .
Oh yes she did! She was played by Jane Fonda. It was in the opening sequence of the movie. You must have seen a censored version. Perhaps, as a devout Catholic he was challenging his own religious beliefs. http://www.patheos.com/blogs/godandthemachine/2012/10/warhol/ 
Pornography is defined as writing or images designed to stimulate sexual excitement. It's constantly around us as entertainment. I'm watching Game of Thrones and that's a lot more graphic any any couch Andy had. The slippery slope of course is when there is lack of consent, or harm is being done. 
I've been thinking about this ( probably not good for me !) and it seems to me that , historically, there was no shortage of ""pornography"" in art, including plenty of homo-erotic depictions , from Ancient Greek and Roman vases and paintings through prints from Japan and China and ""secret works"" by Rowlandson etc and Aubrey Beardsley etc. So what was different here ?

134,Warhol's Homosexuality and Art - Culture,warhol-001,1,"I think it's interesting how many of the themes, subjects, and general creativity may be related back to Andy Warhol's homosexuality and his openness about it. Perhaps viewing the world as an ""outsider"" provided a very distinct viewpoint. Being different and open about it (also his dress, appearance) takes away inhibitions - removes the risk because he's already an outsider. It's not just how he reconciled his sexuality to religion, but how he reconciled his sexuality to life, America, culture, publicity.... As someone has mentioned: ""I don't see why his sexuality should matter"". Perhaps, in America in the 1960's - it really does matter. Was the art influence by his sexuality, and/or was his open living influenced by his art?
 Great point! I think his open living was influenced by his art. 
I think his sexuality is refleccted in his art. In his art but also in his appearence, as you said. Sexuality is something about yourself, is part of you. Without it, you may see things different. That is why I think that yes, what we see in his works is his identity.  As a lifelong follower of Andy Warhol, I am slightly ashamed to admit that I had forgotten the very homoerotic nature of Warhol's initial forays and failures into the world of ""fine art"" throughout the 1950s. The following is a touching and at times chilling profile of Andy Warhol that relies upon source material rather that conjecture and speculation... http://youtu.be/UQXpqQO4vaE 
One can easily speculate Warhol's once overt homoerotic content became ubiquitous and subvert as and after he attained the recognition and notoriety he claimed to desire.
Andy Warhol is very important for the queer culture. Considering his first films about the homoerotic content, we can say his one of the first film makers at this kind at his era. His homosexuality is liquid to all his work, point of view, full of symbolism and allegory. In this way, I believe that his homosexuality was something like an idea for him. 
I am sort of offended by the term queer for people who are gay. I always thought of Warhol as presenting an asexuality. I assumed that it was probably a pose and/or a way of keeping people guessing to increase the mystery and thereby the 'superstardom'. 
The first works that Warhol submitted to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay.The fact that Warhol's homosexuality influenced his work and shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship on the artist and is an issue that Warhol himself addressed in interviews, in conversation with his contemporaries, and in his publications.Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works
 http://www.gallerywarhol.com/andy-warhol-sex-parts-1978-FS-II.173.htm Don't forget the relationship between warhol's openly gay works and art market. The second one loves provocation and that always increases prices. Thats something we must have in mind with warhol, an artist that loved money, and he openly admitted! The openly gay works of warhol is another product of success of his ""factory""
I wonder how different his art would've been if he had taken a different path in his personal life and allowed himself to be openly gay? Perhaps the art would've come back to the same juncture of pop art because in the end he cared most about money and therefore needed to find a way to make art that allowed for that. However, it is interesting to speculate.",elaborates,

I thought this was very interesting, and gave a little insight into how Warhol might have reconciled his feelings for men while remaining devout in a religion that is not always known for it's acceptance of homosexuals. 
I find it very fascinating that he was so openly gay during a time when it was not at all accepted as is it today. Besides being a great artist, he was a strong man to be able to stand up and admit he was homosexual during a time when society did not recognize it. I wonder what he would think now about our society and homosexuality after 20 plus years after he died.

136,The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again),warhol-001,"2,3.","See Extract One in Week Two. I believe this tracks a simple arithmetic logic, but uses a discussion of sex to do so. It is about working a series of a, b logic statements but seeing if it can be made more meaningful to the reader by using attitudes to sex, and then men and women as the a and b variables. 
That book (great title!) is amazing and warholian in the sense that is all very contradictory: logical in its illogical premises, shallow and, because of that, full of deep insights, playful and serious. And it works. I think pop is that: when Nik Cohn talked about pop music he said that sanity and sense killed it. Could this be also applied to pop art? 
With regard to The [so called] Philosophy of Andy Warhol... In March 1974 Andy Warhol signed two book contracts with Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. One contract was for what would become The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again) and the other for a book that Andy planned to do on PAULETTE GODDARD's life. Warhol agreed to give BOB COLACELLO half of the $35,000 advance to ""get him going"" on the proposal and outline. The books were to be titled The and Her (""and if and when Andy did an autobiography, that would be called Me"", according to Colacello). (BC207) The Paulette Goddard book never materialised (she wasn't very forthcoming with Hollywood gossip) and Pat Hackett ended up writing much of the Philosophy book. Bob Colacello gave her half of his advance. According to Colacello, Andy ""absolutely refused to consider"" giving Hackett a percentage of the book's future income and also ""gave her a curt turnoff"" when she asked for a credit - a byline - on the book. (BC208) Pat Hackett: ""On the first book, The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again), I did eight separate interviews with Andy on the basis of which I wrote chapters 1 through 8 and chapter 10. Then, using material from conversations Andy had taped between himself and Bob Colacello and Brigid Berlin, I wrote the introductory chapter and chapters 9, 11, 12, 13 and 14. It was the first major project Andy and I had worked on together, and after the book was published, in 1975, he asked to co-author the second book with him - his memoirs of the sixties, which we decided to call Popism."" (AWDXV) Bob Colacello: ""I hadn't fully comprehended what I'd gotten myself into by ghostwriting the [Philosophy] book, until Andy was photographed for the cover of New York magazine, which had bought the first serial rights. They posed him in a closet, sitting at a typewriter, under a headline that read: 'Andy Warhol's Greatest Secret: He Likes to Write.' It finally hit me then - I was part of a big lie, and while it had lined my pockets, it robbed my ego of any hope of recognition. Pat Hackett probably felt even more ripped off: Nine chapters were wholly hers; four were mostly mine; one, 'The Tingle,' was Brigid's, and all three of us had worked on the prologue."" (BC309) From... http://www.warholstars.org/chron/philosophy.html 


 There was a recent panel discussion on YouTube between Bob Colacello, Brigid Berlin, and Vincent Fremont on Andy Warhol during which they shared, among other stories, anecdotes about how Bob Colacello would get stoned and ""channel"" the voice and philosophy of Andy Warhol while Brigid Berlin took dictation and helped keep Colacello in character. Bob Colacello was Andy Warhol's social collaborator, photographer, and travel companion, as well as editor of Warhol's Interview magazine for twelve years between 1970 and 1982. Brigid Berlin was one of Andy Warhol's ""Superstars"" and appeared in numerous Warhol films including ""Chelsea Girls"" in 1966 and ""Ciao! Manhattan"" in 1972 before working full time as a transcriptionist at Interview magazine from 1975 to beyond Warhol's death in 1987. Vincent Fremont has been working for Warhol since 1969 and was a central contributor to Warhol's film, television, and video forays before serving as vice president of Andy Warhol Enterprises and as one of the named founding members of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts as laid out in Warhol's last will & testament. Until the dissolution in October 2011 of the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board to which he also consulted, Vincent Fremont held a lucrative position as the sole sales agent for artworks in the possession of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=i17g3wPDfa4

Various artists and artistic movements have written manifestoes - here is one by Claes Oldenburg, for instance. Warhol's book is divided into sections on 'Big Themes': Love, Fame, Work, Time, Art, etc. How are we to understand this book - does it straddle the line between autobiography and manifesto?Thanks, Julia - yes, that quote is on the back of my copy of Warhol's Philosophy: some endorsement! I haven't seen Warhol's book framed as a manifesto, but I wonder whether that would be a provocative or useful way of understanding it.

137,Attempt to Murder Warhol : Altamont :: Heyday of The Factory : Woodstock,warhol-001,1,"As the idealism of the ""Summer of Love"" (1967) had its culmination at Woodstock (August 1969) and ended with the murder at Altamont (December 1969), so Andy's vision of an artistic utopia, The Factory, was permanently altered by the attempt on his life by an associate (June 1968). In both cases, a certain naivete about the possibility of collective cooperation was permanently lost. Andy's near-death experience made him, once again, a mirror of his culture, but this time in a most unwelcome way. 
Yes, and Andy took it further by making an artwork of a gun like the one that nearly killed him. I don't think many victims of violence would create an artwork based on their personal experience. The gun silkscreen must have been startling to contemporary society, and it certainly made a statement about the commodity and icon status of the gun at that time.",requests,
138,Printing money?,warhol-001,1,"It seems glaringly obvious now, but it never really occurred to me before that by making prints of dollar bills, Warhol was literally printing money. So not only was he appropriating the image and idea of the bill, he was mimicking its production too. The idea of the exposure of the commodification of art as a piece of art you hang on the wall is also really interesting. Art = money/money = art, therefore art is business. 
",elaborates,"Thanks so much for getting the ball rolling on this subject, Kirsty! You're absolutely right: Warhol's screenprints of dollar bills ask us to think about the different between printing/making money, and screenprinting money/making art. You can see one of these works here . One of the notable differences between Warhol's money prints and actual money is that there are gradations of distinction between the individual dollars in Warhol's work - smudges and smears like in some of his celebrity or Death and Disaster paintings - whereas every single dollar is exactly the same. Or is it? We probably need to draw a distinction between the 'dollar bills' works and the 'dollar signs' works, as their relationship to 'actual money' is somewhat different...An excellent reference, Tania - thanks so much for mentioning this book!

139,How much is it worth?,warhol-001,1,"Prices in the world of art are soaring to historical highs - despite the grim reality of most economic forecasts? What factors do you think contribute to these high costs - is it really ""about the art"" or something else? Do you suspect that Warhol wanted everyone to be able to afford art? 
We all know that Jackson Pollock used house paint to create many of the paintings that now costs hundreds of millions. Part of the price tag goes to the fact that Pollock is such an iconic figure - similar to James Dean (living hard and dying young) Pollock represents the kind of future America was hoping for. If Pollock represents the new Post-WWII American, perhaps Warhol is the proto-teenager who is celebrity worshiping, interested in sex and sexuality, and though smart - is willing to play on the line. These kinds of ""stories"" that get attached to artists will drive up the cost of the work 
 Is it all ? does the price make the art-work great ?.. In this regard the first name coming into my mind is Vincent Van gogh. Not a single painting of him was sold during his life-time. (According to the realistic world that means it is not worthy). But in reality that is not true. The price is not everything. I think the great work never judged with it. I do think it is about something else--status and bragging rights. My opinion is cynical, but do these collectors visit their local museums, and not just the temporary touring exhibitions? Do they appreciate the art they hang on their walls? And no, I don't think Andy wanted anyone who could not pay a price to have his works. Would he have taken a commission to paint an anonymous individual if that person did not have a bag full of green notes?
Hi Richard: Thanks for commenting on this thread - and yes, art is a commodity and has been since, well, hmm, I'm not sure. Certainly the Catholic Church bought art ... but perhaps what we have today is a situation where the market itself is flooded - there might be, some would say, TOO MUCH art, TOO MUCH music, TOO MUCH _________. It's all a matter of how we think about the meaning of these things in our life. Is art a disposable commodity - like pop music or the art Gradnma buys at the Big Box store to hang over her living room sofa? Or is art something else? Can it be both? I couldn't imagine if my Grandma bought a Jeff Koons to hang over her couch that I would then dispose of it when she gets something new ...Art is an investment, sort of like gold. The price paid for an art piece doesn't necessarily mean the buyer even likes the piece of art, just that it has huge monetary value, which will increase with time. In a way the poor economic situation is more of a factor that speeds up the increase of the value of art instead of slowing it down. When the value of money is going down, it might be smart to invest your money on something that's value is going up and sell again when the economic situation is better. 
Iikka: I couldn't agree with you more - indeed, for the ""rich"" these works are nothing more than another item in their investment portfolio. They often don't even display them (or of they do they are in private collections). I don't know if art is the best place to invest your money. FranÃ§ois Pinault, whose collection can be seen in Venice, Italy says that buying contemporary art is almost like gambling. You will never know what will increase in value - so, in the end, he says he buys art because he loves it. (oh, by the way, Pinault owns (or has owned) Samsonite Luggage, Converse shoes, and, ready for this - Christie's Auction House.). And isn't this quote from the readings this week interesting: I like money on the wall. Say you were going to buy a $200,000 painting. I think you should take that money, tie it up, and hang it on the wall. Then when someone visited you the first thing they would see is the money on the wall. 
Instead of buying art, why not just frame the money and hang it on the wall....this is great thinking from Warhol.I think Warhol saw money as a status symbol, and he saw being sharp in business as a status symbol... perhaps it came out of the times or his background, such as a childhood during the Great Depression. I think he had a soft spot for the early 20th century ideas of business, going so far as to name his ""Factory"" analogous to a business owner in industry. 
It is pretty obscure, but I did find a few references to Warhol's childhood during the Depression, not so much how or if it influenced him Perhaps there is someone who has read his autobiography or more interviews than I have who can comment on that, I would be interested. I did find these references, most of statements made by his brother, in various newspapers: The Pittsburgh home, his mother's side business inspired him: http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=20050403&id=Db8wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZQQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3670,65... ""Critics say his upbringing in Depression era Pittsburgh influenced Warhol to be constantly on the lookout for a bargain"" - or perhaps a profitable opportunity? http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&dat=20020301&id=NCovAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UNsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4401,23... attachment to soup part of Depression Era economics http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19971024&id=bNZWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=x-sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5879,59... 
It's obvious that Warhol was afraid of poverty. I doubt that he imagined one of his works selling for more than $100 milliion dollars recently. That might be heaven for him.
Paul- Forgive me- but that is the response of someone who is not afraid of poverty because they have no experience of it. As a homeless MBA graduate with kids perhaps I have a different perspective of fear of poverty. I would go full on Andy Warhol if I ever had an idea as good as his. That is why he is real...Not all collectors are simply investing in art for a return. I went to school with the Schulhofs. The family was very successful in business. Tommy was in my graduating class and Mickey became vice chairman of Sony America. The family's fine art printing business was very successful in its own right. Their mother was the art lover who did not work in business. Her collection of post WWII art that she bought from artists that she got to know primarily in NY and Europe grew and became very valuable, perhaps worth more than several hundred million dollars. The bulk of her collection went to the Guggenheim in Venice recently because she had befriended Peggy Guggenheim. When she was alive, her collection hung in her house. Less than a sixth of the collection went to her heirs. Most went to the Guggenheim in Venice that once was Peggy Guggenheim's house. There may have been tax benefits to making the gift, and perhaps her children and grandchildren didn't need any more money. But if she didn't love the art and artists she collected, why would she have spent 40 years collecting and finally donating it to a museum?

Thanks for posting to this thread Kent - in fact, you'll find that the Schulhof's are currently in the news - being sued for not complying with the last wishes of Peggy Guggenheim. But, that's not why I am replying. Not everyone collects for investment - I am thinking her of Herb and Dorothy Vogel. They were able to amass a fantastic collection while earning no more that $23,000 a year. When they passed, they donating 50 pieces of their collection to each of the 50 states (again earning them a mark in my book). So, money isn't everything and as they say, you can never have enough money. But, I'd sure like to find that out for myself one day ...
Thanks for the clarification Kent - I recently read about the Shulhof/Guggenheim tension and perhaps the essay was from a Guggenheim sympathizer. It's hard to know what can happen in the future with a valuable art collection. Such was the issue with the famous Barnes Foundation collection that was to remain in the home of Mr. Barnes but was eventually ""moved"" to a Phiuladelphia museum (hmm, Warhol's birth state). http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2010/06/the-controversy-over-moving-the-world-s-best-art-collec... 
Kathleen - there was a time when I scraped the bottom - but whether I understand it the way you do, is unlikely. Of course I could say something like it gets better or something like that - but that wouldn't be the right thing to say either. I hope things change for you in a way that you hope.
I agree that the staggeringly large amounts that pieces are going for are motivated by investments as well as bragging right and status. And I would LOVE to know what Warhol would think of his work going for so much. Undoubtedly he'd be thrilled, but I wonder how else he would feel and what else he would think, if anything.
Desiree - when I read your comment I heard Warhol say (in my mind) ""Gee, yeah, that's great"" :-) Thanks for posting on this thread.  Interesting posts. Warhol's work is now being sold for hundreds of thousands ( and millions) of dollars. And yet, he ""stole"" images from random sources, and at times had others complete works he signed. Art is a very strange world!! Prices for art is even stranger!! If I read correctly, Warhol had fallen from favor in the art world in the years before he died. He would I'm sure, be thrilled with his rebirth as a star. 
The famous 20th century composer Igor Stravinsky said the best composers steal. Think of how much appropriation happens in today music and art - it's everywhere I turn. In the end I think it's NOT about where the images come from but what their juxtaposition suggests (and this IS something the artist has complete control over).Warhol's astounding success puts him in the arena with such genii as Picasso and Van Gogh, and he cannot be ignored as a genius in his art to capture strongly the concepts of American culture, both in his day, and, prophetically, today. Norman Rockwell captured an America we all loved; but it no longer exists in the eyes of the world. It still exists in many American hearts, though.
Thanks for posting on this thread Beverly. I think the best artists (from any generation) best capture the times in which they live. This is true for Warhol as much as it is for Rembrandt or Jeff Koons. I have flipped back and forth on Warhol and his genius but was recently convinced when I visited a show called ""Reading Warhol"" at the Broadhorst Museum in Munich. There was a very quiet and dark room that had a book that covered the pictures and newspaper reports on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. It was so powerful and it was then that I realized that Warhol had his finger on the pulse of American culture.Artist's have always painted for money but they have not been quite as explicit as Andy Warhol. He seems to have been the first person to create a business out of art. Art has always been used by people as an investment. Some of these investors end up loosing out as the particular artist ,they were advised to invest in , falls out of fashion but some have grown to really appreciate art.
Anonymous - sorry, but I will disagree with you here. Most of our successful artists painted for money and HAVE been as explicit as Warhol. Whether it is Michelangelo, Caravaggio or Matisse painting for the church, or Rembrandy and Vermeer painting for the rising middle class - painters have always been interested in plying their goods for money. There is however and important distinction that happens in the mid 1800s. In the Medieval/Renaissance period, artists were simply craftsmen. People like Ghiberti, Micehlangelo and da Vinci are simply people who are making things that happen to be thought of (today) as artistic. They are providing a service to the wealthy. Only later did the romantic idea of ""artist"" come in to play (artist as we understand it today is quite different)Supply & demand, location location location...
Art as real estate - yup - I get that!Giovanni Bernini, 17th century sculptor, painter and architect, made a fortune on his art, particularly from the Catholic Pope and aristocrats of his day in Europe. His work will bring you to tears, inspire and tintillate you. He combined spirituality and sexuality. He could make marble drape like silk, and was particularly expert in facial expression. His sculpture, ""The Ecstacy of Saint Theresa"" is breathtaking. There are many websites devoted to it. He was devoutly Catholic, like Warhol, and loved women (not so sure about Warhol on this). Click here: Berniniâs Portrayal of The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa | Sexuality & Love in the Arts 
Ewald - you make a subtle but important point - indeed in the Renaissance workshops prices were determined before! I think ""worth"" is in the eye of the beholder. I may value a Van Gogh over a Warhol...that is my personal choice. What I feel drawn to and what holds meaning for me alone. Art is subjective and the price we pay for a piece of art whether it be to have because I adore it, or to own it, show and to brag about owning it, is what deems one piece ""worth"" more than another to an individual. 
I completely agree Lisa - beauty (worth) IS in the eye of the beholder. Someone may feel particularly connected to a work and will buy it at any cost - others will move on. This is what makes buy art (or real estate) so whimsical (and expensive). And unlike Coca-Coal - art is NOT a great equalizer.Lisa you nail it. 
I wonder what would happen if the world ended and the paintings and other art works became more ""valuable"" as clothing, furniture, and other items to survive....wonder if we could eat them ? 
I agree...but if the world ended would we be enjoying a Warhol painting for our survival or needing to wear his paintings as clothing ? Art is so important for our survival...but when it comes down to actual ""survival?"" I wonder how ""valuable"" all this art becomes...will people burn the Picassos and Warhols for heat ? I think Warhol may wanted everyone to like what he was doing so it would be an overdemand for his work that soared the prices. Somehow it worked. ""Andy Warhol paintings take in more than $100 million at auction"" You can read the whole article, published May 14, 2014, here http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-andy-warhol-auction-20140514-story.html 
Ruth: Thanks for commenting on this thread and also for the fantastic link tot he LA Times article. Here's one thing that I think about - while it's likely true that Warhol wanted everyone to LIKE his works, not everyone (esp. today) can afford them. Doesn't this separate the masses - or better - the haves and the have nots? This aspect may actually not be something Warhol would have been fond of (except perhaps he would have loved the $$$ of it all)I think its interesting that Warhol (and other contempory Artists) work in a time where the Artists are aware of the instant high prices and demand for there works on a consumer level. I guess that this has always been true in the art world to a certain extent, with many of the older Artists working on commissions for wealthy famiies (and the church) for example, but it somehow feels more obvious in modern times. Particularly, when you think about Artists whose works are now regarded in high acclaim (and high expense) but did not receive this kind of recognition in their own lifetimes. Like Van Gogh for example. I wonder how many struggling artists of today, huddled around a 1/2 pint in Hoxton will have there works selling for Millions a hundred years from now. Will any of these 'unknowns' be worth more than a Damien Hirst in the future for example. Food for thought.....
Gary - Thanks for posting on this thread and you are right - no one really knows who is going to be ""hot' in the future (is there even going to be a future???). It's all about marketing - from academics, from galleries, from Museums, from collectors - really from anyone who has an ""in""vested interest in art. (I'm thinking about Peggy Guggenheim right now - were it not for her incrdible promotional spirit many of the works we call ""great"" probably wouldn't be.Sometimes I can't but think that nowadays everything about art is about possession, so in last consequence, also about money. For example the cases of restitution of artwork robbed by the Nazis in WWII. Why is there so much fuss about it, why do big museums shiver that it might come out that one or more of the works exhibited might be in their possession illegally? I don't think it's really because of some sense for justice. Hasn't the art market even museums in his grip? The more interesting (ans oftentimes that means, costly) exhibits you can show, the more people will come, the more money will flow back into your coffers.
I think there has always been a status-minededness about collecting art from popular artists in modern times, which is an obsession of Warhol's himself. Warhol wanted fame and status as much as someone today who might buy his work to show it off as a symbol of their success. I suppose, however, that there are many motivations for purchasing art, whether for investment purposes or for the true love of it. If money was no object for me, I'd buy up the originals of the Picasso reproductions currently on my wall -- why not?! I do wonder, though, if recent surges aren't a result of the emergence of rapidly-growing Asian markets and the related desire for status-giving products following China's oppressive cultural revolution, and subsequent search for cultural identity. When I saw your question I immediately thought of Bordeaux wine and the documentary Red Obsession! 
Meagan: Thanks for commenting on this link and I do think you are on to something. IN fact, the more HYPE anything has, the more everyone wants on that bandwagon (like your Red Obsession reference!). Right now it might be the growing Asian Market, but for decades there has also been a very strong Russian market and soon India will be in the game. But, money travels - so, what was once here could, in the very near future, be there. It's life, no?Speaking about money, Salvador Dali is another good example. He insisted having a pot of hot tar under his Paris hotel room window, lowered a tray of china with a rope into the tar, lifted it up, and said: Another $5000.",elaborates,
140,Art/Money: Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst,warhol-001,1," I feel as if any discussion of AW's legacy will be incomplete without mentioning Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst http://www.jeffkoons.com/site/ http://www.damienhirst.com/ So which one is your favorite? 
Well, Jeff Koons is definitely into the celebrity thing - I never know how seriously to take him. 
 I totally agree, Linda. I think he is phenomenal. I personally cannot stand Jeff Koons. Damien Hirst I like, though. 
I like both for different reasons but i'm not all that familiar with their works. I really like Jeff's balloon sculptures, I find them very invigorating, fun and interesting. Damien Hirst sometimes just put question marks in my head, half the time I have no idea what he is trying to convey but that is why I like him. 
 Jeff Koons. 
I prefer Damien Hirst as well; he tackles mortality head on. I like his use of color in the dot and spin paintings. I like the works with the butterflies as well. Jeff Koons' work and process are so derivative, so crass and garish. Some works are technically brilliant, but it's hard for me to find other redeemable qualities in his work.
Damien Hirst in a real game changer in the art world, in the way that Warhol was. I know some people feel that way about Koons as well, but I just can't see it, and I would love someone who thinks Koons has changed the direction of modern art to explain their point of view to me!
I think the real problem isn't about Koons vs Hirst. As with the most part of contemporary art we have to cope with the problem of the infinite repetition. Since Duchamp, contemporary artists develop a good idea and then they repeat it till exhaustion. Duchamp should have stopped with the first ready made, Andy with the first Marilyn. 
",requests,"Hi. I just retitled this thread to link it more clearly to the general themes of the week. How can we think about money in relation to Warhol, Koons, Hirst, and other artists?

141,Thierry de Duve reading extract,warhol-001,1," ""But Warhol seems to hold out a fourth possibility, one apparently unexplored by the modernists, in order to make art signify that the judgment which names it as such has no more to do with value than it had to do with piety in those days when the aesthetic field was entirely mapped onto the religious field. This path gives up emancipation and has no faith in creativity; it does not claim to right a wrong, since it perceives none; it ignores use value and recognizes only exchange value; it instantiates art not in will but in desire, and a very peculiar one: to be a machine."" In other words.....? I am trying to fully understand this passage from Thierry de Duve. 
",elaborates,"I would understand this passage - the final paragraph from the Thierry de Duve reading this week - as an attempt to explain the strategy or position behind Warhol's work. de Duve feels that we can't make sense of Warhol in the same way that we make sense of the modernists (think Clement Greenberg, Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman) who believed in an emancipatory art practice which might escape the strictures of the culture industry and mass media. Obviously Warhol is not doing this. Instead de Duve suggests Warhol's practice is about the desire to be a machine. A process which perhaps exaggerates the effects of the culture industry (wanting us to become machine-like consumers), rather than opposes it. Hope that helps somewhat. Maybe you read it in a different way? For those wanting a little more of de Duve's writing, which might help put the extract we provided in a broader context, have a look here .

142,Commissions and patronage: Matt Wrbican audio interview,warhol-001,1,"The interview linked from the syllabus page ' Matt Wrbican, chief archivist at the Warhol Museum, on Warhol and collaboration (4 mins 29 s) ' muses about Warhol hiring other artists to produce his work and about the importance of commissions for Warhol. Wrbican seems to me to say that once Warhol worked out themes and styles, other artists in his employ would make the art but Warhol managed them and paid them so it was his art to sell under his own name even if a considerable amount of the creative artistic content would have been theirs. (The 'factory' model with an owner and workers without a claim to recognition for their output?) The commissioned art was said to lead to work that Warhol would not have done unless someone were hiring him (and his factory) to do. (The business model of giving the customer what he wants?) Does anyone know whether the commissioned art is valued more highly or less highly or the same as the art that Warhol originated on his own? (That is, I wonder if there is any lesson about the result of modern patronage?)",elaborates,
143,Warhol and the money,warhol-001,2," I found very interesting section of the course on Warhol and money. did not know many details about these works. I think Warhol had a strong dependence on money, made ââhim feel powerful, confident. He found a way to reach viewers through the interest of their money, for their ambitions and desires. Displaying these works were to feel important and rich, something that most people want.
 Speaking a bit about the process of repeating Warhol think that the first work I perform this way was interesting for people, and continued performing them. these multiple images were of great importance in his career. He took common objects, to important figures, etc.. These works have drawn attention since. They are known worldwide for up to people who are unfamiliar with the art works.

144,Are Warhol's films less Pop Art than Abstract Expressionism?,warhol-001,1,"Thinking about this week's theme of 'Time', I'm interested in how the different parts of Warhol's work fit together (or don't), and how they fit in with what's going on around them. To me, Pop Art is about speed and the 'instant' - instantly recognisable images, often of things that go faster, that save time or that don't last. The films, however, seem to be the opposite of that, using real time or even slowing down time. Do Warhol's films of the Factory Superstars actually have a movement and subconscious expressionism that shares something with the Action Painting of Jackson Pollock? Do films like 'Sleep' and 'Empire' have more in common with a Rothko than a screenprinted Marilyn? We know that Warhol started out his fine art career experimenting with Abstract Expressionism in his painting, but abandoned it in favour of the Pop Art style he was better at. Maybe his Abstract Expressionist sensibilities come out (unconsciously?) in his films? Would love to hear other people's thoughts about this!
If you need to associate them with a movement, hyperrealism perhaps? I'd suggest that perhaps the films are like the screenprints in that they're about what's on the surface, they're deliberately not looking deeper. Disengaged like the Death & Disaster series. Devoid of comment almost. p.s. I used to live in Abernethy, left when I was 5 though and I'm old
Thanks for these really useful links - the discussion on boredom in the Haladyn article is particularly illuminating for this week's topic, I've bookmarked it to read again. I'm aware I'm getting dangerously out of my territory here, but I was interested that Squibb takes as a given that Warhol 'rejects' Abstract Expressionism. From what I have read about this (which, I'll be honest, is limited), Warhol does not appear to reject it in the way, say, Rauschenberg and Johns do, but rather turns his back on it for something that fits him a little better. This may turn into a rejection over time, but it could also just be an absence. I hadn't thought about the collaborations with Basquiat in this way, but maybe they do help demonstrate that Andy and Expressionism weren't mutually exclusive! I'm glad I started this thread, it's helping me tease out a lot of thoughts about the subject - even if I am losing the argument :-).In the film of Glyn Davis, it was posited that the long films are a way of the artist saying that my time is not your time. I believe this is another way of saying that my art is not your art -- my art is conceptual, your art is Thomas Kinkade. As art became more conceptual, it also became more divorced from the general public.
There's a thread somewhere where people discuss what celebrities Warhol would be screenprinting today were he still alive. I wonder which way his work might have gone - whether more conceptual & Turner prize-ish or just producing Marilyn-type screenprints as vanity projects for wealthy celebrities. Is Warhol's time not our time partly because he changed the frame rate of the films? In https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhNiJaoVow , the subject of Sleep says that Warhol got the idea for the film when he was on speed, his perception of time maybe distorted? On the same YouTube film, Warhol's brother says that, when he said he was going to watch one of his movies, Andy advised him to give him his 3 dollars, he'd boot him in the rear end, don't waste your time.",elaborates,"Thanks so much for starting this thread, Allie - this is a really fascinating discussion. And Sandra, thanks for posting the links to those two articles, which are both excellent. A thought about the categorisation of Warhol's films: in addition to categorising them in relation to fine art movements, we can also try and understand them in relation to film movements. For example, Warhol's early, silent experiments with film duration are often discussed in relation to structural film. In the Structural Film Anthology , Peter Gidal provides a really useful introduction to structural film, which you can read some of here . Crucially, he claims that structural film has links to, or similarities with, two fine art movements: abstract expressionism and minimalism. One of the defining characteristics of structural film is that it investigates film as film: the basic components of the medium. Could the same be said of abstract expressionism and painting?Something else we can think about here is the issue of ""wallpaper"", which came up earlier in this thread. A previous post likened Warhol's long films to wallpaper, in that they operate in the background and are not meant to totally entrance the viewer. Greenberg also famously celebrated Pollock's drip paintings for their all-over and radical ""wallpaper"" effect, in that they don't seem to necessarily finish at the edge of the canvas. Is there any way we can use this theme - wallpaper - to perhaps differentiate Warhol's films from Pollock and ab ex, or find any unexpected similarities?

145,Art of Norman Rockwell and the shifting fortunes of time and money,warhol-001,1,"This is an interesting article which links our themes of Time and Money. Rockwell's art was out of fashion, and looked down on by the critics, for decades. But since 9/11 his popularity has soared and anyone who bought his paintings in the 20th century has probably made a very lucrative profit. The article compares him to Warhol, in terms of re-evalution and consequent sales. http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/24/business/norman-rockwell-captures-the-art-markets-eye.html?ref=todayspapersting 
Thanks for the link- and a little personal vindication. As a child, I vividly remember studying Rockwell's covers on the Saturday Evening Post magazines, and loving them. I was a lttle disappointed in my critical abilities when, as an adult, I was told they were not really considered art.
Maybe Warhol and the other Pop Artists helped break down our ideas about what is ""real art"" and what is not.",elaborates,
146,Boredom Repetition and Meaning,warhol-001,1,"I think boredom is a theme that can be found throughout Warhol's body of work. It's in the way he uses repetition. There is a point at which the object (the Empire State Building in the film, the electric chair, the can of soup) loses meaning as an object, and that lets you see it, and the art, in different ways. I think it's especially interesting to notice how you relate differently to the work once you've crossed this threshold. 
I think what you describe and definitely Warhol does is similar to Automatic Writing that writers used to do a century ago. To try to connect with your deepest feelings. The work of art should come from the soul and not the mind. The unconscious that Freud describes as the ""id"" that is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends. 
I hadn't thought of automatic writing, but yes, absolutely. I don't think the mind disengages completely with Warhol's repetition. Rather, with the loss of meaning comes new meaning, you see the form rather than the function of the object. Yes, you got a good point ther because meaning cannot be constructed without the active participation of the mind. But on the other hand, Warhol said ""I want to be a machine"". There is some confusion to that; Warhol wanted actually to be the machine that is stripped of a conscious mind? What did a machine symbolise to him? Only the repetition pattern? What do you think?
I think this is part of it. He is, in a way, taking his agency out of his artwork, stripping his meaning out, but this makes the viewer's agency stronger. In the end, it is us, standing before light colored repetitions of the electric chair, dollar signs or soup cans, who will first lose their meaning and relationship to the real world object, and be forced into new meanings and new ways of seeing. I'm not sure this was what Warhol wanted to do, but he was more aware than many artists of the effects his work had on the audience. I just viewed the 24 hour live webcams established between EarthCam, The Andy Warhol Museum and St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church in Pittsburgh, and I am left a bit speechless. It is past 10:00PM here in Siem Reap, Cambodia, yet I was allowed almost by magic to hear car traffic unlike any I have heard in over a decade and listen to tiny birds chirp as I viewed three Campbell's soup cans atop and little American flags wave near Andy Warhol's grave at what I imagine is 11:00AM on a normal Monday morning in May in Pennsylvania. Then I viewed the live feed set up within the very church a young Andy Warhol would sit with his devout mother sometimes for as long as eight hours and I saw the same iconostasis that Warhol would sit and stare at for hours on end. I can now easily understand how all of the artistic themes explored in Warhol's works have their roots in the repetitive rituals of his childhood. The music was peaceful and eeery. If you have not visited this website, be prepared for subtlety, contemplation, and the infinite luxury of boredom. I am going back tomorrow during my four hour long lunch break to contemplate Warhol's Last Supper Dove and the final writing assignment for this my delightful first MOOC experience. 
 http://www.earthcam.com/usa/pennsylvania/pittsburgh/warhol/",elaborates,"Some great posts and comments on this page - please keep them coming! Sabina's post, which opened this thread, refers to a point in the consumption of an artwork featuring repetition at which perception shifts. I am reminded of the film director Andrei Tarkovsky's comments on film and boredom. He said, in relation to editing, that 'If you extend the normal length of a shot, first you get bored; but if you extend it further still you become interested in it; and if you extend it even more a new quality, a new intensity of attention is born.' Do you agree with Tarkovsky's argument?Kirsten, thanks so much for this observation, which is fascinating. I'm reminded of other films - especially by 'structural film' directors - which also explore atmosphere, wind movement, light shifting, etc. James Benning's films make for a valuable comparison: his 'Ten Skies' features ten lengthy shots, each about ten minutes long, of clouds drifting; his film 'Ruhr' contains lengthy static shots of industrial buildings. I think the interesting question your post raises is how effectively painting and film, as distinct media, can be used to capture things like shifting environmental factors...

147,Can you watch the Empire State for 8 hours ?,warhol-001,1,"Warhol ""played"" with time perception and the different reactions to the film. IÂ´m sure some of the viewers may have thought they were losing their time:)
I think that Empire would be perfect shown on a white wall at a cocktail party-- i.e. don't sit in a chair in front of it and watch it, but refer to it again and again as as beautiful backdrop to what ever is going on in the lives of those around it. This would be especially effective if done in a desert or in an equally rural or remote location. I think Andy would approve of any use of his artwork, if it gave pleasure to some AND they paid a fee for viewing.
I like your idea, and nice remark for the fee. :) In the first week's reading, it was said that Andy didn't even sit still for three minutes to make those Screen Tests , so I really doubt if he himself ever intended to play and watch all those ""Still Movies."" To be honest, no; I could not watch it for eight hours. It was creative, but who could maintain their interest for so many hours?
well regardless if they were or not losing their time we do have to agree that watching it for eight hours can be painful :-) 
Not really, but I really appreciate the play with time and perception (what is important to Warhol) that the film generates.
Even Glyn says u might get bored u might fall asleep in the video :-) 
",elaborates,"Another forum poster described it as a 'wallpaper film', which is a wonderful way to think about its background quality. I think you're right, put the film on in the background and allow your attention to wander. Although, we spend so much time with films/tv nowadays. I mean, I can waste hours in front of a good box set! Perhaps our attitudes to time and film have changed substantially? Sorry Alberto, I should have been clearer! I wasn't suggesting that the two are the same, just that we are much more used to spending long periods of time in front of a screen now, and I think we forget that the experience would have been very different for a viewer fifty years ago.

148,Empire: About the title,warhol-001,1,"I couldn't help but to think about the title ""Empire"" and its relation to the long, expanded ""temporality"" of the film. I wonder if Warhol didn't pick up the building as a symbol of the political role the USA had in that time (in a Cold War context) and created such a long film to stress the status quo of the American society. The course didn't actually directly approached Warhol's works from a historical point of view. I think we could use this space to discuss it a little bit.

149,Screen Tests....Really?,warhol-001,1,"After viewing the first weeks lectures, I was curious about the screen tests done by Warhol. So...of course, I found them on YouTube.com. Initial reaction: huh??? Had Warhol just used the video footage of his subjects? or did he really put it all together as viewed on YouTube ( http://youtu.be/M--oHOn4a0U ). This is a compelling question...as if indeed, he put the entire three min. video together with the shots of Bob Dylan in The Factory, the music in the clip, and the bored video clip of Dylan, then I would view this as a documentary of Bob Dylan and in that regard, yes, Warhol as a film artist. I also viewed another film test ( http://youtu.be/f9Lhxnlri-4 ) from the MacKenzie Art Gallery's homage to Warhol's screen tests with a side note that it was only a re-creation. My question now is: why did Warhols original screen tests need to be more than a minute at most? With the subject not changing at all during a three minute video, was there more to gather after just a minute? The last film test I viewed was of Nico ( http://youtu.be/exFokKr-WEg ). This one was a little more interesting...she plays with her hair, picks up a magazine, turns it into a telescope, even smiles at the gesture...and I admit, I gave a little laugh as well. In general though, his subjects look quisitive, puzzled, scrutinizing, bored, and their facial expressions often seem to question ""what the hell am I doing here?"". Curiously enough...I long to watch more. Perhaps that is the realization of Warhol as an artist...great ones always leave you wanting/anticipating more. 
Try watching Sleep or the film of the Empire State Building, then. ;) I went to a screening of the screen tests at the Museum of Fine Arts Houston several years ago and am proud to admit that I was one of the few people who managed to sit through the whole thing. Most walked out, of course, which is understandable. I'm sure I at least nodded off a few times. If you found some on YouTube with music, though, I'm fairly certain that was added as everything that Warhol recorded was silent in the case of the screen tests. In regards to another thread, I think the screen tests may be the closest Warhol ever got to an actual ""critique"" of celebrity. Of course, screen tests are a real thing and were actively used by Hollywood in the ""golden age"" and beyond to judge how actors and actresses could portray certain emotions, etc. So for Warhol to engage in the same sort of activity but instead with his Superstars and others from the art world and underground scene forms a sort of commentary about who and what was allowed to become famous.
I actually did see Sleep (or part of it I should say!) at the museum in Pittsburgh. zzzzzzzzzzzzz....lol Agreed on the critique of the celebrities...in an usual sort of way. In the end, he did achieve his dream of wanting to be famous. It's all about the journey : ) The screen tests were all actually silent.Musicians Britta and Dean were commissioned to do a soundtrack for ten of the screen tests which is available on DVD. I find them mesmerising and quite hypnotic. The length of the test was due to the size of the film reel that Andy was using. Warhol often filmed things in a static way...like his film of the mpire State Building - which I believe is around 8 hours long. 
Lisa-I am puzzled by the screen tests as well. One thing that surprises me is the willingness of the subjects to just sit there. I wonder how Warhol convinced them to do it and what the subjects thought the purpose was.It comes across as a mutual admiration society-Warhol was fascinated by his subjects and the subjects were fascinated by Warhol. 
They were projected at a slower speed than what they were filmed at, so the subject was actually sitting for less time that what you see in the screen test. I find them quite mesmerising too, but see them as portraits rather than what we think of as screen tests. 
Like how nobody just posts photos on facebook anymore, it's all GIFs and short video. Maybe, like Kirsty says, think of the screen tests as non-static portrait photographs. Who says a portait has to be static, afterall? And it's not like portrait photography or painting always captures the sitter doing something interesting, they're usually just... sitting! I love watching Warhol's screen tests. Just saw a few at a gallery in Las Vegas this year. It seems it was a required ritual every time a new person visited the factory. I thought to myself, if it were me, and I was directed by Warhol to just sit and look at the camera for a couple of minutes before I could enter the party going on, what would I do? It was interesting to watch how comfortable some were, versus how self conscious others were. Plus, these extended portraits give you a great idea of how a person would look on film, and some great insights into the personalities. 
'Screen test' can maybe be read in two different ways - the traditional test to test an actor or lighting etc or, in this case, a test of the people being filmed and put under extended scrutiny for the screen. One minute of filming might feel quite comfortable for the subjects, by extending it more of them will be taken out of their comfort zone. With the screen tests of celebrities in particular, focusing on their moving faces for more than a few moments can make the viewer look at and see them differently - making them seem more 'human' than the 'icons' we thought of them as before. So Warhol both creates celebrities and makes them more like us again.
Yes, the screen tests let you see the ""aura"" of the subjects.Its hard not to see some of these screen tests as anything other than people just posing. I find watching people intriguing, but some of them just seem so put on. Nico- such a beautiful girl- but is it that intriguing? Shes just posing and looking around. Is there more to it im not seeing?
I think the screen tests are brilliant. They are about ""the gaze"" and looking. I mean what is visual art about if not looking. The screen tests are also about getting behind the masks that all people wear and probably especially celebrities. And we know that Andy wore his Andy suit and he was in many ways a facade. But having the camera on the sitter with the sitter having no purpose really but to sit and look at it causes the person to react. When the viewer's eyes meet the subjects eyes, i feel we somehow feel voyeuristic...like we are peeping into a show where we are taking something from the subject against their will. Also, their are comparisons to be made between the screen test and the traditional practice of sitters ""sitting to"" an artist, and in many cases this was a strenuous and stressful process. There is something very disturbing, too, about the screen tests. It is that looking at them now.....with the subjects being either dead or old (Sedgwick and Dylan), the passing of time and the fleeting nature of human life, of our life is more poignant. And I find them rather dramatic. The screen tests offer many points of entry for the viewer and lots to ponder and take away. I like them very much. 
Many screen tests show a diversity of behavior models pictures, but surprisingly little improvisation. The models actually seem to have been caught and about to be interrogated, but the question is never . 
Screen tests use the concept of repetition to make people seem boring and ordinary. In my understanding, Warhol was all about making everything seem tangible. Screen tests appear to be an extension of this.",elaborates,
150,Anthony d'Offay Interview,warhol-001,1,"This was really fascinating - thanks for posting. For me it was really interesting to get an insight into how Warhol worked with dealers/gallerists. I was quite surprised that he asked d'Offay what it was he wanted, then less surprised when he subverted that to what worked for him and what ultimately worked for d'Offay too. A great anecdote!
",social,"Thanks, Victoria - really glad you enjoyed the video! There's much more Anthony d'Offay to come next week - this video acts as a kind of teaser. Good point. In fact, many contemporary artists have teams of assistants and makers working for them to help in the fabrication of their art, but this is rarely discussed. The reputation of so many artists relies on the unseen (and often unacknowledged) labour of a group of employees. But does this matter? Is it the idea - rather than its execution - which is of importance? 
"
151,Andy's Alternative Cinema,warhol-001,1," Of course we call Andy's filmmaking alternate. But that almost doesn't put a fine enough point on it. The history of media is the repeating story of wild, game changing, Utopian dreaming, innovation, that is colonized and domesticated to... well... to present the banal culture Andy celebrated in the pursuit of selling the products he immortalized: Coca Cola, Soap, etc. About already enslaved media like Radio, Film & Television we can ponder ""what if?"" About The Internet, currently under the lash, but not yet completely domesticated, we can battle over Net Neutrality. Andy may have idolized celebrity, but his filmmaking was about as un-Hollywood as one can imagine. What would our world, our media, and our culture be like in some alternate reality where ""Hollywood Filmmaking"" never really took hold, and style was dominated by ""Warhol Filmmaking""? When I look back at the Screen Tests of half a century ago I see Andy prefiguring aesthetic pursuits ranging from Bill Viola's oeuvre to Marina Abramovic's The Artist is Present. We often think of Andy as pop superficiality, yet the Screen Tests offer an intensity of lived presence that Hollywood Filmmaking doesn't dare consider. 
",elaborates,"Thanks, Edie. This is a really interesting argument. But I think we need to acknowledge that Warhol was in thrall to Hollywood. And I wonder to what extent we can only understand his cinema as a riposte or challenge to the norms that had been established by Hollywood?Well, it's certainly true that his films were often collaborative ventures - with particular writers (Chuck Wein, Ronald Tavel), for instance. But Warhol was responsible for making almost all of his films. Only towards the end of his productive period of filmmaking - around 1967-8 - did he start to entrust direction to Paul Morrissey, who had been working with him on his films for a while by that point. If you can remember where you heard that other artists had a hand in Warhol's films, we could work through those claims in this thread!"
152,The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,warhol-001,1,"Walter Benjamin's seminal ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"" (1936) discusses the change in the way people see works of art once they are surrounded by copies. I have always thought it telling that he speaks in terms of power--the authority of the original ( its aura) is dependent on our perception of it as singular but also on some ineffable unreproducible uniqueness. This may work for painting and sculpture but clearly does not for AW's chosen media: film, photography and silk screen, all of which can be said to have no singular original. This is even more the case with digital images that are infinitely repeatable AND lacking in materiality. IMO this short essay is essential to any discussion of Pop Art or the current art of our time. I would like to try an on-line discussion of this essay. You can find the complete text at <marxists.org>",elaborates,"Thank you Alison for bringing this up. You are right in thinking that this essay might be useful in order to understand Warhol's use of reproductive techniques and processes. There are two sides of Benjamin's essay however. The first, which you mention, is the negative reading of mechanical reproduction, as something which de-auratizes the work, leaving it detached from tradition and historical meaning. Here is a quote from the essay in support of this: ""The authenticity of a thing is the essence of all that is transmissible from its beginning, ranging from its substantive duration to its testimony to the history which it has experienced. Since the historical testimony rests on the authenticity, the former, too, is jeopardized by reproduction when substantive duration ceases to matter. And what is really jeopardized when the historical testimony is affected is the authority of the object. One might subsume the eliminated element in the term ""aura"" and go on to say: that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art. This is a symptomatic process whose significance points beyond the realm of art. One might generalize by saying: the technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition."" However Benjamin suggests that we can also see the de-auratized work as positive: something more democratic and political.He writes: ""An analysis of art in the age of mechanical reproduction must do justice to these relationships, for they lead us to an all-important insight: for the first time in world history, mechanical reproduction emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual. To an ever greater degree the work of art reproduced becomes the work of art designed for reproducibility. From a photographic negative, for example, one can make any number of prints; to ask for the ""authentic"" print makes no sense. But the instant the criterion of authenticity ceases to be applicable to artistic production, the total function of art is reversed. Instead of being based on ritual, it begins to be based on another practice â politics."" Can Warhol's work be read in this way? Or would you see his use of reproductive processes as something which empties the work of everything: both 'ritual' and 'politics'? Thanks for your comment Francisco, its true that these writers criticized the pop culture of their time as part of their wider criticisms of the culture industry. However, if you consult the quotations from Benjamin's ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"" at the beginning of this thread, you will see that Benjamin's position regarding the 'aura' is enigmatic. An auratic work being one which is connected to tradition, and a de-auratized work being one which is cut from its ties to art's ritual, and which is therefore allowed to be more properly political (as it does not need to meet the demands of an art historical lineage). In your reading, how would you suggest that Benjamin was wrong about ""aura""?

153,the role attributed to Andy's mother,warhol-001,7,"What about this segment of Andy's life?
 Bob Colacello: ""The last portrait Andy [Warhol] painted at the old Factory in 1974 was of his mother, Julia Warhola, who had died two years before, though Andy avoided telling anyone about it, including Jed [Johnson]. Julia had been in a Pittsburgh nursing home for nineteen months before she died... Andy had avoided mentioning that fact, too, and Jed was under strict orders not to say a word. Andy paid for the nursing home, but never visited her there. He called her every day and she begged him to come see her...""

The artist just simply manually tweak the background and dress, without manipulating her face. Andy's mother, Julia, tried to compensate for the loss of her husband directing his affection for his children. When Andy was a child he had a nervous disease and his mother kept him busy with creative activities: comics, books, newpapers and he discovered hollywood stars .... Coincidently, Antiques Road Show recently featured some Soup Cans signed by Warhol. The owner of the cans had known Warhol, and had asked him specifically to sign the cans. Warhol signed each of them twice for good measure. He also had also bought a Campbell Soup can poster for a few dollars. They were worth tens of thousands of dollars now. It was great seeing them. 
I'm not sure that a mom in a nursing home in Pittsburgh would rate very highly in his celebrity world. His whole persona (thinking about this at this point in my course) seems very disconnected from people that couldn't get him where he wanted to go (godfather of Pop Art).
The online article ""The Mother"": http://tissuemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/35_tissue03.jpg 
 I don't think Andrew Warhola would have become Andy Warhol without his mother's influence. She supported his drawing when he was a child, brought him to church (the art within the church was a great influence on his style), lettered some of his early efforts (pamphlets of art he distributed to commercial art editors and friends, even signing his name on them), and did an excellent job of smothering him with attention from his birth to her death. She would watch him sleep as a child and even as an adult - an influence on his film 'Sleep' from 1963?",elaborates,

155,Copyright,warhol-001,1,"what are the current laws against the appropiation of art in the U.S and internationally? Can a collage artist use magazine images and not get sued? are art galleries afraid of representing artists that are using appropiation due to the rise of copyright laws? 
Unless an image is in the public domain, it is protected by copyright. This applies to 2D and 3D images. Technically you are supposed to get the permission of the image's creator, even if you are using a portion of it. Sometimes it is hard to identify who that might be. This restriction includes using images on blogs, but excludes one-time use for educational purposes. The reality is, we all do it to some degree and will not likely get into trouble for this behaviour, until we become as famous as Warhol. There's a common language summary of US guidelines on copyright laws.com.
In Argentina copyright laws are really strict, since there's no such thing as ""fair use"" (which the US legislation stipulates) when it comes to visual arts. Not only a artist could get sued for making collages with copyrighted works, but they also have to pay for the use of works that are under public domain to the National Fund of Arts- in that case they're not seeking for permission, just paying some sort of tax, and the collected money is used by this institution to create art prices, scholarships, exhibitions, etc. Nevertheless, local artists are quite ill-informed on this subject, and they take the risk anyways...
That's a great question Karen. Were the copyright laws different in the 1960s? How did Warhol get away with using images of Marilyn and Elvis for example? I'm sure if I borrowed a photo of Lady Gaga or Lana Del Rey and used it for an artwork, their lawyers would be right on top of it. On the other hand, I'm sure Campbell's Soup was flattered by the free publicity. They actually released 50th anniversary momento soup cans in late 2012! They're selling for $40+ on E bay now!! How's that for weirdness!",elaborates,"Great question, to which I do not know the answer. Although I'm sure lots of us wouldn't worry too much about a large company like Campbell's having their design appropriated, how do you feel about an artist who appropriates other artists' works - like Sherrie Levine, for example? It takes on a whole different meaning. I know that in 'After Walker Evans' Levine rephotographed his photos out of a catalogue and presented them as her own work in a gallery. I agree with you though, a lot of 1980s artists were exploring the ethics of appropriation at this time and questioning the idea of the 'original' and 'ownership'. But with the Evans' photographs (of poor Americans during the great depression), and with Warhol's multiple images of celebrities, the extra question of ownership over individuals and their representation comes into play also. I think we tend to assume that celebrities have 'asked for it' by being famous, but not so much the documentary subjects of Evans photographs. That actually reminds me of an artist I saw a few years ago called Sarah Davis, who appropriated Warhol's style and painted young female celebrities getting in and out of cars flashing their underwear (remember when that was tabloid fodder for a while?) http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/reviews/robinson/robinson3-4-09_detail.asp?picnum=1"

157,Who are the other notable artists who have made artworks in response to Warhol's...,warhol-001,30,"...explorations into celebrity culture? Would Cindy Sherman be one of them? Who else have contributed to the dialogue? 
I guess you could pay attention to the work of current chinese contemporaries in the Political Pop scene, such as Yue Minjun and Wang Guangyi. They use a graphical style similar to Warhol's to critique China's current emphasis on consumerist and celebrity culture. Warhol has a very broad influence on many modern day artists. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Guangyi 
Takashi Murakami? Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons? 
Definitely Murakami - multiplicity of images.I wouldn't include Cindy Sherman in the same vein as Andy Warhol. Sherman wears wigs and outfits, and looks different from image to image. And none of the images are of Sherman but of the character she is playing. Sherman is quite anonymous in her images. Would you recognise her if you met her? Warhol wears more or less the same wig, more or less similar outfits, and is creating an image of Andy Warhol. I reckon, I reckon. 
I would consider Shepard Fairey to be working in a similar style to Warhol's early celebrity images. Something that I find interesting is that Warhol used to be able to ""appropriate"" images to transform into his art. When Shepard Fairey created his famous Obamam HOPE poster the news photographer who took the original image of Obama claimed it was copyright infringement. I don't think anyone could get away with using commercial images in art these days. 
George W. Bush's portraits of famous people are taken from Google Images - so there is at least one person getting away with using commercial images.Hello I think Jean-Micheel Basquiat. who had collaborated with Warhol. They will inspire each other. 
 http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/jean-michel-basquiat/philistines the images in this link are much more representative of Basquiat's work. The expressionistic qualities of his paintings as well as the subject matter (his paintings are more about his identity as a black man in an alienated world i think) is not similar to Warhol's work. John Stezaker appropriates old Hollywood PR photos to critically reexamine the cult of the celebrity. While infinitely more closely associated with Surrealism, than Pop, his strategies of collaging and appropriation examine the culture's obsession with celebrity rather than worship it a la Warhol. 
Another interesting link. I believe that there are now ethical issues with photo collage using vintage photos such as those done by John Stezaker (left). Another connection is the work of David Hockney, who is well know for photo collage (right) but that's another tangent.  After I saw the topic, I searched some articles and realized some artists who had artworks not as a response to Warhol's works besides they can be two artists who can be influenced by Warhol and I wanted to share them with you. http://www.thukralandtagra.com/1358-2/ here you can see some of their works. 
 That was totally unexpected. I like. Also chuck close. Who isn't influenced by Warhol - these days it seems sequential design is just part of the process, right? 
I have an acquaintance (San Marata) who finished second to Andy in a photography competition in 1968/69 (?) while San was living in Greenwich Village. 
Let me suggest the film Exit Through the Gift Shop, and while it is about art (mostly street artist Banksy), it is also (probably) about the creation of an artist (or ""artist"") in the person of Mister Brainwash. Who gets his 15 minutes of fame, to boot. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587707/?ref_=nv_sr_3 
 I totally loved that film. Had totally forgotten, that was screened on C4 some time ago. So funny and totally on par. Banksy is a legend and celeb but no one knows wtf he is! I for one, hope we never find out! On the influence of the work of Andy Warhol, the Metropolitan Museum of New York conducted an exhibition of works by the same artists and sixty more. Among the names mentioned are contemporaries of Warhol and creators of other generations as Jeff Koons, Cindy Sherman, Elizabeth Peyton, Alex Katz, Ai Weiwei, Robert Mapplethorpe, Jean Michel Basquiat.

158,Warhol and me: a basic values difference?,warhol-001,1,"Watching the videos for the first week, I realized that part of what is challenging for me around Warhol's work boils down to a fundamental values difference between us. He seems to be captivated by not only the concept of celebrity but also the mainstream (I'm thinking of Campbell's soup, etc.). I hope to learn more in this course and figure out what interesting take he has on these concepts but so far it appears to me that he is just fueling the value of celebrity worship and the mainstream. I find this hard to get behind. I suspect that I am missing his point so I have tried to view his work through different lenses: Freudian, anthropological, etc. but if I have to work this hard to try to find an angle that says something interesting, I feel that I am likely to be putting words in his mouth, so to speak. Is his work just too ambiguous for my taste? Possibly. 
I'm glad to see that I'm not alone. I just don't ""get"" his work. It's interesting but taken individually none of his works seem particularly well done or innovative. And as a body of work I'm left thinking that it's such a waste of talent. He's a fascinating individual but he seems to just embody celebrity for its own sake. 
You are definately not alone, most people have the same problem when they come in contact with pop art, including me! So, first of all, I think a mistake most of us do, not only about Warhol and Pop Art but for art in general, is that we think based on today. It's totally normal of course, but, to comprehend the art of the past better, we should consider the circumstances at the time the work was produced. For example, the era in which Warhol started working, was post war America. The States had just started emerging dynamically after WW 2, while most of the other countries that were involved suffered great damage. Industrialization was growing RAPIDLY and money started flowing in. All this was new to the people of the country so it must have been something fascinating, the ""American Dream"". Everybody got infatuated with these new things, whether it was mass produced things or celebrities, but in reality, all it created was an illusion of fulfilment, and that's exactly what Warhol and other pop artists critisize or emancipate. For example, by multiplying pictures of Marylin Monroe -and other celebrities- he took away ALL meaning from her. He emphasized on the symbol, the icon that Hollywood had created, not the human Marylin. He said he loved all things pop, but at the same time, I believe he completely understood the emptiness of it all and that's why he liked it so much, because thanks to that, he could hide comfortably behind a persona. After all he was very shy, as far as I know. And all of this is reflected on the way he was using to make his works, screenprint, so the works looked like they were manifactured in a factory, not made by hand. As for the depth of his work, there was nothing specific. Not in the meaning of philosophical backgrounds ect, at least. I believe that in order to understand pop art, we just have to think about life and our own experiences and let go, because what's happening now in the world and pop culture, is what was happening then, multiplied by 100! And that's another mistake we often do, we try to find a meaning in everything and we get too deep in theories and histories. Sometimes a painting can be just aesthetically pleasing and I don't think it diminishes its value, we just have to see it for what it is. And pop art is all about appearance, surface and color! So that's my view, or at least part of it, since it's a huge discussion! I am by no means an expert, but I have been reading about pop art for quite a few years now so I think I could give you an idea of what it's all about. Of course, from now on it's up to you, but I would encourrage you to keep on exploring it, it's very interesting. 

 Always consider Warhol one of those people who can fully understand the time in which they were living, the hole society and the future projection of his own present. The introductory video to the theme of celebrities by Glyn Davis confirmed me this personal appreciation. Warhol understood the consumer society and gave new products to consume: new celebrities, new artworks as close to them as the products they saw on television. The very same boxes of soap that the working class could see at the supermarket. He began as a collector of portraits of famous actors and ended being acreator of new celebrities. Warhol predicted the new purpose of the twentieth-century American society, everyone wants to be famous and everyone can be famous. There is a new paradise for this society: the celebrity, hollywood, to became famous no matter what. And he also gave a new hell, the other side of the coin: murders, electric chairs and accidents. The other protagonists of his artworks and the media. 
I very much appreciate the insightful comments in this thread. You have given me a lot to think about. Maybe what is still confounding to me is judging art and its value or knowing which lens to use. I teach English (literature, writing, etc.); we choose to keep reading literature because of the universal truths it addresses - timeless issues. This is why Sophocles and Shakespeare speak to us as much today as ever - they address core human concepts that resonate well throughout time. There are some books that are quite popular today but will be completely forgotten about in 50 or 100 years (and therefore probably cannot be considered ""great literature""). They are not as I believe Ben Jonson said in the First Folio ""for all time"". Maybe I am expecting such durability as a determining criteria of highly valued art and maybe that is appropriate. Maybe viewing Warhol's work through the lens of his time and his time only is the sole appropriate lens to use and I should be looking to learn about his time, not about my own time or my own understanding. Or I can learn about his time and his it informs my own time and my own understanding of life and the human condition. Lots to think about....",elaborates,
159,Andy Warhol’s Index,warhol-001,1," I do not know how many art books Warhol realised but the book format seems particularly suited to him. n the video presentation of the curator of the library is not interested to the written text . Main story seems to be replaced by a multitude of icons of stories ( = text + image ) exploded and reassembled as the most daring layouts of magazines Still it is a narrative work. Not in the literary sense, rather as an experience the reader gets embarking on a journey through time as instantaneous perception is impossible. 
Re: The Index Book - oh my god PLAY the flexi disc please - ?!?! They must surely have ways of playing it safely and surely knowing what is on it is more important than keeping it in situ? I mean, as soon as they record what is on it they can put it back in the book. Listening to it is actually a part of the work surely? It's like hanging a painting back to front and revering it for its authorship without actually being able to see what it is.
I am so thankful to this course for the video of the Index book! It left me wondering, though, why it's never been reprinted in some sort of facsimile fashion. Perhaps Random House still owns the copyright.
I was also delighted to see this video Index invited very active and curious looking
Index would be a great book to own. I really liked the video. But I needed more time on each page. I won't be able to read it myself, so I wanted to know more of the texts. All the art was fantastic, the balloon and the acordeon and the record etc. They were all great ideas. I wish it could be re-printed!

Yes, but other Coursera courses have set the bar really high! Take a look at Archaeology's Dirty Little Secrets for example!!!
Totally agree but the Professor, Sue Alcock, is an exceptional teacher. My favourite Coursera course as she was so engaging.I guess it's a conceptualization issue. For me, professors are not required to make the material fun in order for me to review it. I chose to take the course because I have an interest in the subject and that should be enough for me to watch a 30 minute lecture. It rubs me the wrong way when college level (or above) students imply that they should be amused in order to pay attention to the material. Sure, great professors know how to make their lectures engaging, but not every professor is capable of it. Complaining about a free course seems odd to me, and a bit entitled to tell the truth. 
I took ADLS 2014 as well; with Sue's videos, I had a grasp on what I should or should not be taking notes on. While I jotted some things down during the first video here today, I was a little lost on what to write down during the next two videos. Other than that, though, far be it from me to complain about a free course. If I don't like it, I can always un-enroll. =)
I have to agree with the negative posts. If anyone is not familiar with Warhol's associates, they would be out of luck. At least, have some titles with the spelling of the names mentioned. Of course, pics of Edie Sedgwick and others would be so much more helpful than just a quick reference to them. How about pictures from the Tate show mentioned in the interview? 
During the first week of the course i would have appreciated to have examined more in depth some historical and cultural context. I hope to get more of it during next weeks. 

And I think also not every student likes the way Sue did the video's at ADLS 2014. She was too much for me, tried to be funny all the time. But that's not a problem, that's the way she is, and I'm different.I done the Beatles course and the lecturer was fantastic. I have to say the lecturer in the second and third video is very monotonous. The topic is celebrity, The fabulous life..... the lecture could stand to be a bit more flamboyant. (sorry)
 Which is of course what I will do if the course doesn't get more provocative and interesting. I don't think we're being rude by giving our honest assessment so far. I presume the people offering the course want some honest feedback on how it's is being received. Life is way too short to be bored and there are many, many other courses available vying for my time and attention. 
Giving honest feedback and your opinion is not the same as saying that the videos are so boring as to be unwatchable and implying that if that does not change you'll drop the class, as if you were someone so important that things have to go your way or else. That's what I take issue with. By the way, that's the proverbial ""you"" and not you personally. 

And that's why I said I felt that position is entitled. If entertainment is extra, then I don't see the problem nor the need to, as you put it, protest. If, on the other hand, the problem is that the course is too basic and you already know this stuff, that's a different thing. My last MOOC had all of their videos over and done with prior to the class even starting. Working on that assumption here (and based on how Dr. Davis replied in the thread about audio quality), I will reserve judgments and critiques until the end of the course. If this is anything like the last course I took, there will be start/middle/end of course surveys for that purpose, and perhaps even a 'suggestions' thread at the conclusion.

I, too, found the videos helpful and interesting. The themes were introductory, perhaps, but I assume they will become more in-depth. I do wonder about the week three quiz and just what we should expect with that. But, I learned some things I didn't know and thought the Tate Modern assistant curator was rehearsed and stayed on topic; it didn't seem random to me at all.
I have actually played the video and then engaged with the discussion threads whilst listening as I found it more like a radio broadcast. However, I am here to learn something new and that has been achieved. I wish I knew what I had to do for the piece I have to do for assessment next week as I would like to get on with it. All the MOOCs are different The Tate Modern curator has taught me something already and I now plan to visit in the near future as I see Marilyn Diptych 1962 is displayed there. Learning for Week 1, box ticked. 
To begin I ask an apology for my grammar, because my original language is Spanish. I think the course is perfect as are introductory courses, and which passes from his biography to the profession of the basic way ... and this leads us to investigate further for ourselves
I am from South Africa, I went to a university which is regarded to be a 'top' art school in our country. I am absolutely amazed by this course, I find it engaging and super informative. To be hearing from top academics and an assistant curator of the Tate is extremely cool! I feel so priveledged that a 'free' course can offer me so much insight and from significant individuals! 
Fell asleep during second video. 
I enjoy Art History and found the talks interesting. I am sure we will learn more as the course progresses.

161,Is Warhol great because his work forces us to question our culture?,warhol-001,1,"I have to admit, I was not very interested in Warhol's work before. I took the class so I could learn why he is such a prominent figure in the art world. Reading about him satisfies some curiosity, but interestingly enough, it is the discussions and debates that people have about his work that are more interesting to me. Is this the essence of Warhol's work? To question so called reality? 
I find Warhol interesting in so far as he is so independent and non conformist. I think he stands out like Salvador Dali as unusual and original. What is art? What are the limits? In the beginning maybe cave scratchings, then religious icons, then landscapes, then modern and pop art with a social message. what next?
 I think his work played on the vanity of the stars he 'painted' and I guess it gave him something to do. I think you are right. He had a thing about repetition. I suppose giving similar treatment to Marilyn Monroe and Campbell's Soup says something about his values.. 
 I like this chain of thought. Even in his repetition Warhol was different. He played with color and technique. I wonder if Marilyn Monroe would have had the 'staying' power without the art of Warhol? Perhaps the pop culture works both ways as far as popularity of celebrities is concerned. Whatever, his popularity has lasted 50 years and here we are studying him in a course from Scotland. Interesting. 
How much of Warhol's personna was for real and how much for effect ? Did he use bizarre aspects of his personality as a selling tool or was he genuinely eccentric ?",elaborates,
162,Conceptual Art,warhol-001,1,"Was Warohl a conceptual artist, and has anyone got a good definition as to what makes a conceptual artists. ???
If Wikipedia is the font of all knowledge (cough) then Warhol doesn't get a mention. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_art 
It's where the idea takes precedence over the aesthetic, i.e. the idea and the means of producing it are more important than the finished product. There is an interesting article which explains it in great detail here: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conceptual-art/#ConArtWhaIt 
 I reckon that the means of production and aesthetic are paramount to warhol's image making. I believe his own personal process is central and also vital to his obsession with making - more so than the content of the image itself. On this note alone I feel Warhol could be considerd relative to concept art. Warhol takes ready made images of celebrity (in his early portrait years at least). He doesn't waste time contriving images of his own- he borrows them from popular culture. He gets right in there, straight into production. Ready mades. Not saying Warhol is or isn't a conceptual artist, it's just his process is, I think, the most observed and readily seized part of his work. Nah, I don't think Warhol is a purist conceptual artist like Duchamp, but he is definitely heavily influenced by and educated about them. My point is that the sequential design, the multiples and building of visual databases seem to be THE concept - his method of making, it's very similar, and related to the idea of ""procedure over aesthetic"" as you write above. But I think that because Warhol's subject matter invariably would be celebrity - at least at this point in this course- that his method of production and interest in sequence/collection could be overlooked as most important because it is so subtle and yet so obvious. Not so obvious as iconic images of iconic celebs mind you. Kirsty baring there is a definite sense of 'no art' or 'anti art' about Warhol works and I just love that rawness. It may not be Duchamp's Fountain but it definitely punches you in the face. I wonder if Warhol used a different kind of image, say a clichÃ©d vase of flowers, would it make me want to rock out like a punk? No. Conceptual art it seems to me an excuse to make poor art. It has to do with the idea behind the subject. Is related to what the artist is thinking and trying to share using an artistic expression. The conceptual artists is someone who is trying to make us reflect about what is going on around us. It's a kind of witness of our times. Honestly, I have problems to understand modern art, or even Warhol's pop art, cause I think there is a kind of fraud in these conceptual artists work. That's why Im here following this classes, is an attempt to change my mind and understand better this kind of art. 
I would say Duchamp was perhaps the originator of Conceptual Art with his seminal and utterly provocative urinal artwork entitled Fountain. That was created way back in 1917. I'm not sure i would consider Warhol as a conceptual artist in the fullest but i do think his art, sometimes, could be considered as conceptual. For example, regarding the fact that the importance in the art work is that Warhol was the one who thought of it, the creator of the idea . Whether he did it (with his own hands) or not, is irrelevant. 
Hello Young Ha Tan, nice to meet you! I guess Art always brings a polemical discussion, isnt 'it? We all have different opinion and points of views about it. To me, many of conceptual art seems like a fraud. Warhol is different cause he used to draw very well, so I think he had talent. But in cases like Damien Hirst for example, I don't think he makes art. I can't see a jaw in a glass like a work of art, but only as a Peace of scientific exploration. I think now everybody can be an artist, you don't have to be good to be respected as one. In Renaissance, artists used to work really hard. They went to school and had a very deep knowledge about all forms of art. Now, you can put a lot of trash together and say: Look what a beautiful conceptual art I have made! Sorry, But I can't buy this. To me me, this is fraud. 
Hey!! I'm liking this debate very much! I agree with what ""anonymous"" said. It is easier to relate to a realistic painting becuase we ""understand"" what we are seeing. There is not much more to it: we either like it, or we don't. And if we don't have to understand the painting, we can then pay attention to the ""craft"", if it took the artist a lot of time to finish the painting, if the details are precise, etc. Contemporary art is deffintely more difficult to get, becuase it's so much more than if ""i like or deslike""the painting. There's the thing!! You talked about Hirst, and about blue canvases... we can't just judge what's in front of us as we do with a landscape from the fifteenth century, we have to STUDY and READ and INVESTIGATE the artist, the context, and most importantly, WHY did the artist do this or that... is there an explanation behind the paintin or the sculpture or the photograph or whatever? What is the artist trying to tell us? In my opinion, that's what makes conceptual art so much more interesting: it makes us think!! not just contemplete and enjoy. The spectator is now part of artI would definitely say there was a link with Duchamp in Warhol's appropriation of the 'ready-made', but there is still a prioritisation of the aesthetic over the conceptual. In fact Warhol's position seems almost anti-concept - he is simply reflecting the society he lives in from his point of view.
Concept art is about idea (not necessarily 'meaning') --and to me, his coy nature of saying that things don't mean anything, or his lack of 'intention' was part of his whole act, and brings a deep and complex irony to the situation of images, media, the spectacle of our world that directs our desires. To make us aware of how fickle we are with images and that we do not think they have much power--but they do. Many thanks to everyone for replying to the conceptual art thread. It has been a greatboon to me. I recently started a course on conceptual art ,and must admit up to now has left me baffled. !!
When I saw some of his art work displayed they had James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Campbells Soup Cans...I suppose I would consider the pop art conceptual...the concept being pop...popular people, celebrities...popular soup...who has never had a can of Campbells Soup? Who has never heard of James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis...I would consider them all connected in pop culture in someway and would consider it concept or conceptual art....
Hi Pam, I agree with you. At minimum Warhol lapped at the edges of conceptual art. Clearly his Polaroids, which moved passed individual instances of portraiture and moved into something much larger and more conceptual. I do not have any problem framing all of Warhol's discrete works as well as the magazines, TV show, Factory as a a single conceptual work. Let's not be confused with art that is formed around a concept and ""conceptual art"". All artists begin with an idea (concept) towards which they work. Perhaps where conceptual art takes a new path is that it is not simply visual but intellectual too. The ""idea"" is part & parcel with the art. They cannot really be separated. Conceptual art makes statements, asks questions and make you think.
 I like these definitions. Thanks Catherine! So would you say that conceptual art includes the definition of ""concept""? But that concept all by itself cannot lead to ""conceptual art""? I think all of the art pieces are conceptual. The artist is a human with ideas and for him to make something he think about it first, even if it's a dream like the surrealist artist would say. So i think of if it came from a brain conception, an idea, an image, a phrase, something, it has to be consider as conceptual. Andy's art, for example, are the product of the idealization and at the same time degradation of the celebrity life style, put them in to the light but at the same time reduce them with the repetition, for example, is the concept of Marilyn's piece that was in the first video. The concept is in everything because everything starts with an idea.
I am not saying that word degradation as a bad thing, i am saying that is not just always to present an immaculate image of the celebrities, he also want to present them, as you said, as imperfect, as human. I really like your point of view.  And I like yours, it is really spontaneous letting ideas reel off of other peoples ideas. I don't know if I would have thought as I did without reading how you wrote above. Do you think Warhol thought about how an audience would read his images? Do you think Warhol contrived what we read in his images, or do you think that was not his main objective? 
I think he definitely think that that the audience would read this images in their own way but he might think it would be the same way as he did because he was such a public person and he actually write books about his point of view like The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again), so probably he ponder that the idea behind his work was clear. Is a guess answer. What do you think?  HelloÂ¡Â¡Â¡, before posting anything I confess that I do not speak English. I have taken the course because I study art history and I really like this type of course but there are very few in Spanish. As Celia Cruz said, my english it not very good looking , but I'll do the best I can. I'm Cuban but I live in Santo Domingo. About Conceptual Art Conceptual art is that in which prevails the idea of ââartistic achievement, becoming more important processes of intellectual development of the work that the formal elements, therefore I do not think Warhol is a conceptual artist. The origins of conceptual art can be found around 1917 when Marcel Duchamp with categorical naturally present the urinary in the first exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York , questioning the nature of art and undermining secular values ââso far claimed the academy. The art ceases to be pure representation and concept is becoming. Among the manifestations of conceptual art can be counted Arte Povera, the ready-made, body art, or spontaneous happenings or actions. I do not think Warhol is a conceptual artist, and not share the precepts of many conceptual artists of his time as Joseph Kosuth , Rauschenberg , Abramovic or Klein. But the concept, Warhol predominant form before content, appropriates the language of advertising and makes his way to express himself. I think he was the precursor of a new form of consecration of the artist, by the avid upper class eager to be part of an intellectual elite at all costs, taking at the most goyesco style their own dreams of reason. One example of this is his prodigal son Jean Michel Basquiat, a graffiti artist with great talent, as there are many on the streets of New York, with an unprecedented success without reason. To classify him already exists Warhol Pop Art , of which he is the father and has its unique characteristics including the references in popular culture. Like any artistic movement borders are very subtle and can see some conceptual in some kind of Pop Art , Pop in some of Dadaism , some Dada in Surrealism, and so infinitely , art is not black and white. 
Nice to meet you, Gretel. Thank you for your comments. I do see your point, but I disagree (gently). We are shaped by our times and with an artist like Warhol, much of how we view him is shaped by reception history. If he were to appear today, I think the art world would perceive him in a different, more conceptual way. i would consider Warhol as a conceptual artist. he places in the ideas first over form. and i think that schema has given rise to contemporary art. not only in visual art but of equal importance in literature, film, and multi-dimentional art.",elaborates,
163,Did Warhol ever presented an in-depth critique of the culture of celebrity?,warhol-001,1,"Through his interviews or his artwork? Or was he more of an artist that just explored (or laid bare?) the mechanism or dynamics of celebrity? 
I know it's unattractive to answer a question with a question, but could he present a critique of the culture of celebrity? From my impression he was too in love, too involved, and too driven by it to give any kind of critique or objective reading of celebrity culture.
I'm currently reading ""A More Beautiful Question"" so your question is not the least unattractive to many:-) Not that I know of. His mechanism was to present that critique as art rather than something more formal.
I agree with this. As noted, he was interested in the process of celebrity as much as the celebrity itself. Think of all of his media that used celebrity - visual, magazine, film. His images of reproduction of celebrities bring to mind Walter Benjamin's The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.Since critique can be defined as Observation, Analysis, Interpretation, and Evaluation, I'd say Warhol definitely was an acute observer, and he facilitated others to become acute observers. The screen test series helps viewers to develop (almost forces you into) observational critique of all the portraits you watch. Then it forces you to think of the whole history of portraiture before film. I think Marc's question showcases Warhol's too-close-and-too-in-love to perform an analysis or interpretation at the time. But as a director Warhol's evaluation of who to film, who to make prints of, and who to interview was key to the success of any project involving people, celebrities, or people he made into celebrities. As a director Warhol was a master of observational critique of his community of creatives. In relation to other art going on at the time Warhol could be seen as producing a responsive body of work that grew from his personal interpretation of the art world, advertising world, contemporary news, and entertainment world of the time. Warhol maintained such a neutral, step away-from-the-camera persona, that it's hard to say why he did anything, because he didn't actually say why. Now we can art historically interpret and analyze away. I'm looking forward to watching the MOOC and our art historian mentors work on Warhol. 
I agree that it would be tough for him to have a true critique of celebrity, particularly as he himself became more famous. From the outside looking in, it is easier to be objective, to remember what is the everyday person average. When you're in that world, though, when you yourself are famous, you must lose some of that objectivity, I believe. Things that used to be extravagant or exotic or even ""crazy"" may take on a more normal shade as they become part of your everyday existence. 
I appreciate that Marc has raised this important question. When I visited the National Portrait Gallery in London four years ago, I felt that many of the portraits of celebrities actually gave enticing insight into the lives of celebrities and invited me to want to know more about them. For example, there was a wonderful portrait of Germaine Greer by Paula Rego that I love to just look at and wonder about even though I know so little about the subject. To paint in this way, it seems to me that the artist has to be a little detached from the person and the celebrity-hood of the person being painted. In the case of Warhol, I believe that he was happy not to step outside of a self-referential celebrity loop that revealed little of the painter (himself) or the subject and does't really invite the individual gazing upon the painting to enter it. I mean, do we really know any more about Jackie, Marilyn or Liz Taylor because of his cultural production? That does not mean that they are not beautiful. But beautiful in . . . well, a marketing kind of aesthetic. 
I think the point is that we know less about the celebrity rather than more. Warhol is pointing to the creation (and process) of the celebrity - not the content - but the image itself. (Another good book would be Boorstin's The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America). As to whether Warhol could comment on celebrity - why not? One of the challenges for artists is to be able to continue to comment on life even as the art that they make takes them away from the lite that they originally lead. (Philip Roth continues to write about the same subjects even though he no longer is part of them.) To play on Hemingway, what is the difference between celebrities and non-celebrities? Celebrities are famous.I just read over the postings and realized that Yong Hau Tan had initiated this thread. So my thanks to you for starting us out as well as to Marc and others who picked up the discussion. 
 I agree with the earlier post that AW offered less about the celebrity through the art he created. If we look at the process, he used images and techniques over and over and over..... He was distilling an idea, object or form for his own purpose, be it commercial gain or artistic endeavour. (If we look to other artists, Turner - atmospheric landscapes, Van Gogh application of paint onto canvas, etc, the artist was searching for a resolution to a question they had). Do we, as observers want for him to be offering a critique? Why is the art / work not in itself a whole or resolved outcome for the viewer? This post question is excellent because it raises more question than I can answer because it forces me to the question; what is it exactly that we want from art / artists?
