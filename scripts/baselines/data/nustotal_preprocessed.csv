0,Lesson 7 exercise - instructor's solution,classicalcomp-001,social,"I've seen this question asked a few times but no definitive answers (an answer from Dr Edwards other staff would be most welcome):  In Lesson 7, Dr Edwards asks us to write the harmony for the final phrase and then come back and check our work.Â  I've been unable to find a solution to check against.Â  Is there one?Â  Where is it?!  I know that many have shared their solutions in the forums - this is very helpful, but I'm wondering if I'm missing something.  Thanks for your help! 
I have the same question.",,2,0
1,Final assignment: number of bars,classicalcomp-001,resolves,"I know mine is short enough. I can'tÂ possibly use all the things we learned in such a short piece. I looked up binary form and I found an example by Mozart (sonata in A major) and it is very short also only about 20 or so measures counting the repeated bars.
 Hi Peter,  Firstly, thanks for a very interesting and useful course.  Secondly,Â  I have a question about the final assignment: What do you mean by 20-30bars?Â  Is that the number of written bars or the number of barsto be played?Â  For example, if I have 4 bars which end with a repeat sign doesthat count as 4 bars or 8 bars? if I have 5 bars where the fourth bar is a firsttime ending and the fifth bar is a second time ending is that 5 bars or 9 bars?  Once again, thanks for a great course,  Ed    
I have the same question. I don't know. I know when I listen to it on playback those repeated measures are played back again and it ""sounds"" extra bars. Maybe in the next lecture Dr. Edwards will clarify.
Same question from me,  Adding three cadences to 30 bars really breaks the melodic component. Â It will be much nicer if we can have 30 bars of written music with a repeated part ending in a H.C. and D.C. before concluding in a PAC. Â 
To fit in all the elements asked for in the final assignment within 20-30 bars will be hard enough. I would not cut it down to 10-15 by counting the repeats. 
Hi Bradley, Do you know the K number for that piece?Â  Or can you give me a link to it? I'd like to have a look at it.  
Mozart piano sonata K 331. I have an example of it in a text book and says it starts out in rounded binary. The book I have is Tonal harmony by Stepfan Kostka and Dorothy Payne. I'm sure you can find an example online.
Thanks, Bradley.<br />","Thanks, Bradley.<br />

2,my solution to assign 4,classicalcomp-001,resolves,"#URLREF   If anyone can comment on this I would much appreciate it.Â  I have a simpler harmony after the Dec cadence partly to save time but also I think it makes a nice effect .  I don't much like the overall result though!    
I think some of your note choices could be improved in the second phrase. For example, in bar 6 an F natural would sound better to my ear than the F sharp. In bar 8, you have a B flat in the oboe and a B natural in the piano chord, which I don't think is stylistically acceptable. Also in bar 8, I don't understand the chord on the second beat - I think a G in the left hand would be better that the D, which doesn't belong to the chord if it's meant to be C minor (i). Those are the main things that jump out at me.  Is your DC at bars 10-11? It doesn't really sound like a cadence, because the music doesn't stop at all.",,2,0
3,Lesson 3 Handout,classicalcomp-001,resolves,"Looks good to me, personally I think that doubling the fifth in a root position chord like that is absolutely fine. The rule of thumb would be to double the root, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it mandatory, at least not for purposes outside this course. Speaking just for the course, you'd probably have to wait for our TA to weigh in ;) 
On the iv chord in bar 2 (5 mins into the video), while using the common tone approach (here the note G between Gm and Cm Prof. Edwards investigates 2 possibilities : either keep the G in the tenor or in the soprano... is there any stylistic guideline or rule that says we shouldn't keep both Gs using the common tone approach ?   While drilling myself, here's what I thought was a clean answer :   Is it mandatory to double the root ? Here I doubled the fifth, but the voice leading seems fine, no ?   Here is my resulting cadential 6/4 :    Doesn't sound as good I reckon.",,2,0

5,Why can't I get a pleasing melody for the Circle of 5th progression when paying extra attention to tendency notes?,classicalcomp-001,requests,"Did anyone try to resolve tendency notes in this assignment? I did that for all three and the other two works pretty well due to my opinion but it hears really bad for the first one. So I had to adopt the solution.  In the link, my version comes followed the solution. Maybe you can also tell that whether my version of the second progression is too pop-like.   #URLREF

That looks really good to me ... no parallel fifths or other obvious violations. Â The jumps in the tenor in the first measure seem a little large but I don't think they're strictly forbidden.

12,Are my chord subsitutions ok and is this parallel period?,classicalcomp-001,resolves,"Hard to tell.Â  The labeling for your chords came out unreadable.Â  Too lazy to go through note by note to see which chords you used. 
Here's my attempt at week four's assignment:  #URLREF   I think I have a HC at bar 4-5, a DC at bar 10-11 and a PAC at the end of the piece. I have used substitutions in bar 7 (vii diminished for V) and bar 9 (VI for i). Are these ok?  Also, does this count as parallel period (the extension from bar 11 to the end)? I recycled one of the given rhythms but altered it slightly by tying over the bar line.  One other question: are five-bar phrases stylistically correct for this period? I'm more used to modern styles where multiples of four bars are much more common. Thanks for any feedback. 
It sounds pretty good. I like it. Too bad we can't read the chords. I believe five bar patterns are perfectly acceptable and your work counts as parallel period but don't take my word for it here is my solution.  #URLREF   Like you I fear I might have taken it a bit too far and changed it beyond the style, but I just couldn't help it.  
Thanks, Rodrigo. I'm sorry that the chords didn't come out right on my score, but I don't think we should be judging a piece by looking at someone's analysis, which can easily be incorrect. Listening and looking at the notes are more accurate indicators.<br /><br />I like your version, but I don't think the cadences work. You don't have a PAC at the end because you have the third #MATH.<br /><br />However, I think you are on the right track and most of your chords are analysed correctly.<br />
Thank you Patrick. You are absolutely right, the e-flats escaped my proof-reading. I have now fixed the root notes and added a quaver rest in bar 5 to give it a better sense of cadence. I'll have a better look at it this weekend and make a few more changes.  I heard your piece again and it looks and sounds very good to me.

Ya, I thought having the single solution for the first bar was the reasonable one.<br /><br />I'm not sure of the period, as I'm really new to the subject matter, but I do know that the old choral tradition #MATH, was a response. This would have been early-ish 18th century.<br /><br />While I don't know exactly where the rules that we're dealing with spring from, it may be helpful to think of them in this acoustic space rather than a modern, clean acoustic environment.

And this is probably where we get the concept of sonority with independence.<br /><br />But I have severely limited information and you should probably take all of the above with a healthy dose of salt. It would be really interesting to hear more of the acoustic environment and tradition from which these rules are extended.<br />
I'm not entirely sure but I have sung some pieces where both altos and sopranos had to leap a full octave. As long as the distances between voices don't grow too far I suppose an octave is fair game. Â 
The bass has to make large leaps, because all our chords are root position. The bass has the luxury of moving an octave.  The voicing principles state that SAT voices should only move the smallest interval possible. What is the largest interval that they should ever move? What interval must they never move?  I tried looking in the Voice Leading Principles link on the left side of the page  #URLREF#URLREF-001/wiki/VoiceLeading  but I did not find exactly what I'm asking. I remember hearing something about this in the lecture videos, but I would like it clearly stated which intervals are forbidden in SAT. 
I would think the soprano voice, which usually has the melody, could do most anything.Â  In the song ""Over the Rainbow"" the melody starts with a leap of an octave.Â  Â  some...where ^....","Ya, I thought having the single solution for the first bar was the reasonable one.<br /><br />I'm not sure of the period, as I'm really new to the subject matter, but I do know that the old choral tradition #MATH, was a response.

15,Any advice welcome! my week 4 assignment,classicalcomp-001,resolves,"Here is my effort. What do you think?  #URLREF    
Just a couple of thoughts. In the melody, at the end of bar 2 you are on the leading tone, b natural. It's not very idiomatic NOT to resolve that up to the c. Sounds odd. To avoid the problem, you might consider dropping the melody in the second bar by a third. Then it would be fine to have the oboe end the measure on a G and then go to the Eb. I think that your deceptive cadence is harmonically fine but that it rhythmically comes to to much of a stop. I'd keep the rhythm in the accompaniment moving along as normal. Similarly, at the final cadence, I'd keep the movement in accompaniment going until the final chord. Nice job.   
Hi everyone  Here's my nearly finished #MATH . I think it uses aug 2nd intervals - is this still a voice leading rule even though this is for instruments not SATB?Â   I've altered the melody rhythm in Bar 5 also - is this possible.

18,Doubling the 5th in voice leading practice,classicalcomp-001,elaborates,"There are actually some more deviations from the simple rules presented in the lectures in that segment of the solution: the last chord in the third measure is in close form, the first two in measure four are in open form, and the rest again in close    form, and the V in measure four has a tripled root note and no fifth. Now all is fair in love and art, but it would be really useful if the solutions would mention alternative posibilities and the rationale behind choices that are not immediately    obvious.  For comparision, here is my solution for these two measures. It contains the fifth for both the V7 and V chords, has doubled root notes and consistently uses close form starting with the last chord in measure 3:     
Dr Edwards says explicitly in the videos that whilst continuing with the same structure as started is the usual, it's perfectly acceptable to switch with from open to close and vice-versa.<br /><br />As for the other problems mentioned in this thread (doubling the 5th instead of the root in bar 3, &nbsp;and tripling the root without 5th in bar 4), I'm as puzzled. I can only assume it's a mistake in the solution and hope that thumbing up this thread will catch the TA and instructor's attention to clarify.
In the third measure, the last chord is a I chord and i got it wrong simply because i didn't double the 5th, i doubled the root instead. I was wondering if anyone else had a similar problem and/or could explain the reasoning behind the doubling of the 5th in this specific practice. Other than that I made little technical errors.  thanks, Kristen
Same question here. I've got the same problem in the 4th measure, 3rd chord. In my solution the tenor is playing an E instead of an A. Is this just a matter of taste, or am I missing a ""rule"" here? 
Hi Evert,&nbsp; if you put the tenor on an E on the third beat of bar 4, you have parallel fifths between the tenor and bass from beat 3 to beat four - A/E #MATH always regarded as something to .avoid in this kind of music; have a look at the reference materials.<br /><br />But bear in mind that in music there is not always only one right answer, so even though your version is different to the given answer, it could still be theoretically correct - it is sometimes just a matter of taste, as you say...<br /><br />
I've got the same problem with the bar 3 and 4. Â The 4th chord in bar 3 i had 'D - F# - D - A' (BTAS) as the solution gives 'D - A - F# - A', and the 3rd chord in bar 4 i had 'A - E - C# - A' but 'A - A - C# - A'    
Thanks Paul,&nbsp;<br />I found the parallel 5th that i didn't see before. it's on the 3rd and 4th beat of bar 4. I was working too hard on the 2nd and 3rd and missed it.<br /><br />Thx to Michel and Sharon too. You guys are the best!
My guess would be that since the chord is on an upbeat the doubled 5th doesn't matter quite as much. Typically doubling the 5th is bad practice due to it not contributing to the identity of the chord.","Dr Edwards says explicitly in the videos that whilst continuing with the same structure as started is the usual, it's perfectly acceptable to switch with from open to close and vice-versa.<br /><br />As for the other problems mentioned in this thread (doubling the 5th instead of the root in bar 3, &nbsp;and tripling the root without 5th in bar 4), I'm as puzzled.

If you do a whole circle of fifths progression at one measure per chord change, thenÂ  it will pretty much dominate your piece, especially if you are restricted to 20-30 measures in rounded binary form. But if you go to a quicker harmonic rhythm, say one chord change per beat, you can get through any of the sequential progressions pretty quickly, say in 2-3 measures. It would fit pretty well near the end of your B section before you get back to A'.  Also, though, as a peer reviewer, I wouldn't ding you if you just did four chord changes out of the circle of fiths, either. 
If you want to write authentically in the style of Mozart you would definitely not go through the entire circle of fifths! It gets to be a bit much!  
Hi! Â I was just wondering if we could have just a few measures following one of the progressions shown in class? Â Lets say like 4 measures of the circle of fifths progression instead of the whole thing??? Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Thanks!...",,4,0
20,Week 2 Assignments solutions,classicalcomp-001,elaborates,"HI Matija! Thanks for sharing. Getting to critique your assignment helps me learn this stuff, too!  This might not be complete, but this is what I noticed:  1. In measure one, you have the alto part sing an F on the second chord. Since this chord is listed as V64, it is not a seventh chord and so there would be no F included here.  2. In the second chord of measure 2, you have doubled the fifth. This tends to leave a ""hollower"" sound for a chord in root position, and it would be preferable to double the root.  3. In measure 4, you have the tenor on E and the alto on G, when this chord is actually provided by the assignment with the tenor singing G and the alto E (like your next chord).  4. In measure 6, second chord, you've doubled the third; doubling the root again would be preferable  5. in measure 7, you have the bass go up an octave. While it could be a fine decision in itself, you stay up in that register for a little while, setting up a very awkward (and perhaps unorthodox?) leap of a ninth in between measures 8 and 9.  6. Finally, I challenge you to write this using four separate voices (i.e., one stem for soprano, alto, tenor and bass). You seem to have this in measure 12 on the last chord. Use the ""u"" key to write for the upper voice (soprano or tenor) and ""l"" to write for the lower. This is particularly important in measure nine where the bass has those quarter notes.  Good job, and thanks again! And feel free to critique my critique, you or anyone :)

21,Lesson 3 - Basic Progressions: Misleading?,classicalcomp-001,elaborates,"I think the thing is, the dominant (V) is so important, that for beginners, it's worth just focusing on that to start with.
Just because it is more common doesn't invalidate I-IV-I. I-IV-I is actually quite common in classical music. (I.e. plagal candences)
I feel that Lesson 3 is very misleading, especially for those just starting out in this stuff. The diagram fails to represent many very common progressions such as I - IV - I. Perhaps it will be elaborated on in the future, but I think using such a diagram is very limiting. Chords can move in such a wide variety of ways, to put them in a diagram would be vastly complicated.  
Because they're not relevant when you're first learning about the fundamentals of chord patterns.
 I would disagree, as beginners will just have to learn otherwise. I don't see why the introduction of non-leading tone centered progressions can't be introduced. 
It's  classical music Â basic progression. I - V - I is much more common. 
I thought the diagram was interesting if obviously not exhaustive. Â I was more bothered by the idea that tonic chord could move to anything in the diagram including iii. Â I'm pretty certain we never hear I - iii #MATH in classical chord progressions.
How are they not relevant? A plagal cadence is one of the fundamental cadences, and other progressions that wouldn't fit into this chart aren't too rare either. If beginners are being taught the basic chords I thru viio, then they should know how to use them.",,8,0

Yes, this is allowed. The progression you describe sounds fine to me, except the I64 would usually be I6, I think.
A progression like I-IV-V-I is standard and allowed. The first chord can be repeated, I-I-I-IV-V-I. But can I repeat chords within the progression? Is something like this allowed, especially with inversions =>Â I-I64-IV-IV6-V-V6-I",,3,0

26,Fifths and octaves by contrary motion forbidden??,classicalcomp-001,elaborates,"The Voice Leading Principles in the Reference Materials #MATH state in #1 under the second set of numbered principles: ""Avoid parallel fifths and octaves, as well as fifths and octaves by contrary motion.""  Avoid fifths and octaves by contrary motion?? I've never heard this as a voice-leading principle, and this doesn't make any sense. If parallel as well as direct fifths and octaves are forbidden, then the only other possibilities are approaching octaves and fifths by stepwise motion or by contrary motion. Keeping in mind the goal of the maximum independence of the voices, the best of these options would seem to be contrary motion. Also, at this point, since we're dealing with all root position triads and a limited progression palette, there's no way to avoid having fifths and octaves in sequence. Why is this then forbidden?  
It's been years since I studied these ""rules"" for the first time, and I don't remember this one either, however, it does make sense, even though the movement is contrary, the acoustic effect is very similar to parallel octaves. In the example given on the page you linked, there would be a fairly easy solution to avoid this.

How strict is this rule?  A similar question: should I manage appropriate distance between alto and tenor at the cost of sonority?  #MATH  
 It would be helpful if you define what do you mean by sonority in this case :)  To expand a bit on a comment I wrote in that thread:     Remember that's it's a four part writing, not a piano piece.Â   A piano playing in octaves or fifths gives certain richness to the sound which may be perfectly fine if that's the effect you're going for.Â  However it will not be two separate voices that happen to stay an octave apart, it would sound at best as a single voice that ""plays octaves"".      So when there are parallel perfect intervals between voices that otherwise move independently, it's as if they're suddenly merged intoÂ  a single voice and then separate again after the parallels end. It may not be apparent when the chords are played by piano, but if each voice is actuallyÂ   a separate instrument, the sense of emptiness produced by parallels is much more pronounced.  
 It's worth bearing in mind the actual sonic character of parallel fifths/octaves (for which ""emptiness"" is a good description, I think). For example, try deliberately sticking a parallel fifth into your solution for the week's assignment (after finishing it properly first!) and listen back to it. It will likely ""stick out"" of the soundscape and feel not at home.  Of course, as Dr. Edwards I think mentioned there are styles of music in which parallel fifths are no problem. That's the whole point: style. A musical style is almost like a collection of archetypal elements or sonic forms that cohere together. In the style of classical diatonic harmony, parallel fifths don't cohere to the overall sonic fingerprint of the style, ""sticking out"" in an odd manner. That's why, from an artistic perspective, we avoid them in this style. (Only once the style has been mastered, can a composer proceed to break the cookbook's rules in a way which is artistically pleasing and maintains the style.) 
Pavel, I would say it's important to stick to the rules for this one. All the greats broke them though only after they had laboriously learned them!

Take a look at the measures below from Mozart K. 488, measures 3-5:   My question is this. I identified the first chord #MATH as anything but passing tones, and without them it doesn't seem much of a VII chord.  Since I know that Prof. Edwards is a  lot  better at this than I am, what am I missing? 
I too had the second of the circled chords as a iio7. But after I saw this thread, I listened yet again to the recording that was offered. I then pulled out my guitar and concentrated on just that measure ... VI6 --> iio7. I then realized that I didn't account for the E natural initially ... I was paying too much attention to the G#-B-D-F#, thinking that the short-lived E-naturals were, as was mentioned, passing tones. Once I adjusted for the E-natural, Prof. Edwards' analysis made sense. The only word that came to mind was ""subtle"" use of harmony here.
Frederic,  Thank you very much. That's a very interesting and helpful analysis. My only resistance is that I don't really hear the E as part of the chord. I approach music as a singer, and I couldn't imagine any way of giving that line a contour that highlights the E in any way. I see how in your analysis the E is mostly implied anyway, so its momentary appearances in the melody may serve only to reinforce (but  very  subtly) that implication. Mind you, I'm not fighting for the iio7! I actually think your reading has merit, and does much to account for the III chord. 
#MATH- thats what I get for not paying closer attention to   classical era roman numeral analysis .  Classical: o7 = r b3 b5 b7 vs. Â Modern: o7 = r b3 b5 bb7. You want believe how I look at the It+6, Gr+6 and Fr+6 chords- but it works- Thanks again-Sam E.
Â am getting hung in the second measure- how does that chord come out to a viio4/2- the F#,D and A is clearly is a D major triad or VI6. If I use the F# as a pedal tone and the A melody as a suspension I get D , B and G# that then is a viio4/3 can somebody please help- what am I missing or dont see?  
Hey Dominic, rereading myself, I realized that you can understand the chord G#-B-D-F# and the E as a passing tone. You have therefore a VII chord with a major seventh in it. This is rare but could work.Â 
Dominic, I did the same thing in that I initially labeled your second circled chord as iio7. Â I also read Frederic's reply, which makes sense to me re: borrowing chords from the corresponding major mode. Â So, basically, that chord functions in the MAJOR #MATH wouldn't make sense in that context given the corresponding major progression?
I also analyzed the second chord as iio7, I'd like to hear what others have to say about this. 
Yes, I did the same thing too!<br /><br />
Hello Dominic and Al, here is how I understand this chord progression based what I learned at the music academy. I will try to give you my thought process. I think it may be helpful:    The first chord can be analyzed as VI6. This raises alarms bell for me as the VI chord is very rarely in first inversion. Indeed as a VI6 chord is so close to a I chord, the specificity of VI is not very present. Therefore it is not used. So I usually tell myself we're not in Kansas anymore i.e. we somehow changed tonality.  If you go to the end of the phrase, there is clearly a I chord in F#. So what happened before that  If we go back one chord, we have III in F#. This is usually a chord that we don't see in classical piece except in a cycle of fifths progression. However, I know that the III chord in minor is the I chord of the corresponding major mode. Could we be in A major?  With this in mind, let's analyze the chord before that. The G# goes to the A and the B goes to the A too. Could G# be a laeding tone and we would have a V in A major #MATH, I would like to understand that as a passage that is borrowed in the corresponding major mode without necessarily modulating. So I analyze this passage in F# minor like this: corresponding IV - corresponding V - corresponding I - I  This is for me a way to understand the progressio using more usual chords than VII and III while still staying in F# minor  Hope this helps","Yes, I did the same thing too!<br /><br />

Basically, it means to score it like the assignment for week 4 (which was oboe with piano), or, thinking of the vocal line as an instrument, like ""Der MÃ¼ller und der Bach"" by Schubert. This will mean that the melody is in the solo instrument, and the accompaniment will be in the piano. As we have seen, an accompaniment can be made quite interesting, rhythmically and otherwise!  Does that help? 
Thank you ! 
  It should be scored for piano with a solo instrument  I'm not sure what this means. Could anyone please explain?  Is the piano part just accompaniment? 
Could it also be possible to attempt counterpoint in the final assignment? - mixing homophony/melody&accompaniment with polyphony? I envisage this as perhaps featuring solo instrument melody, and a piano left hand or right hand counterpoint with the other hand playing chords.Â","Look on the left of the home page.

65,My attempt to the assignment,classicalcomp-001,resolves,"This is a good start.  You may have missed the principle that in root position chords the third should not be doubled.  You have a chord with a doubled third in almost every measure (every measure except mm. 1, 3, and 9), and two in measure 6.  In measure 3 you have a chord which is missing a third.  The third should not be omitted, because it's what lets us know if a chord is major or minor, which is a characteristic part of this style period.  (Unlike say rock music with its open fifths power chords).  In measures 6 and 7 you have chords with the tenor and alto more than an octave apart.  The upper voices should not exceed an octave between tenor and alto, and between alto and soprano.

I've completed the first assignment but my ""solution"" differs from the solution proposed by prof. Edwards.  I've changed some parallel fifth that I had missed but now I can't understand whether my solution is just an alternative or I missed some other rule.

Here's the file:Â   #URLREF   For those using Noteflight here's the link:  #URLREF  (I think it requires to login to NiteFlight)  Thanks!   
Low and high notes are good to use on things like the last note, the second to last note, or somewhere you want a special emphasis.
Question about parallel 3rds...I see a bunch of them in the professors solution. Â I tried to avoid using parallel thirds as much as I could in doing the assignment. Â   Is it that (for the classical style) we should avoid only 5th's and Octaves? Â (Are parallel thirds not to be avoided or even encouraged?)   
<p>I think parallel thirds are fine.  They&#39;re not &quot;out of style&quot; the way parallel fifths and octaves are.</p>

One thing to keep in mind also is the voicing in Bass line. Â In one place in the song, you use a low E in the bass line. Â In lecture 2, it is shown that a low E is in the bass range - however, as a person who sings bass, it is a note that is on the outer edge of the range for most basses to hit. Â Therefore you would want to use it sparingly and only for significant effect. Â What you did with the placement of the low E isn't incorrect, but it would probably be better to have the Bass up an octave instead there.
Thanks Brian. I had read of not using the lowest (or higest) notes in a voice range but it completely slipped out of my mind. I'll remember it from now on.<br /><br /><br />

67,Is the ii7 chord in Diatonic Minor diminished or half-dimished?,classicalcomp-001,resolves,"I agree with you: half-diminished. 
In lesson 1, Dr. Ed says that ii7 is a a diminished seventh chord but I checked it and it seems to me that it's a half-diminished seventh since it has the notes D, F, Ab, C being 1, b3, b5, b7 and not bb7. Am I missing something?",,2,0
68,Mediant (iii) and Chord Substitutions,classicalcomp-001,elaborates,"Here's another question. Â Can the fourth scale degree function as a ""secondary leading tone?"" Â The major third and the perfect fourth are only a semitone apart. Â This is similar to the situation with the normal seventh leading tone next to the tonic. Â For example, consider the attached fragment. Â The (dissonant) tritone is resolved by the leading tone resolving up to the tonic. Â And fourth resolves down to the third.   
The interval of a third plays such a major role in this type of harmony. Â For example, in determining the chord quality (major or minor). Â You can omit the fifth, but not the third, etc. Â I would think that one should be a role to play for a triad based on the third scale degree.
When Professor Edwards discussed diatonic chord substitutions in the Week 4 lectures, there was no mention of the mediant or iii chord. Â All of the other six scale degrees were touched upon. Â Is there a more of a role for the mediant #MATH, for example when stating a second theme in sonata form.
Great question. I stumbled upon a I6 - V43 - III - V - I progression that seemed to fit the P.A.C. quite well.  No idea if it's ""right"" or not.   I've been keeping an eye out for some kind of comment on that.   
I'm curious wheter the third scale degree should be seen as an augmented chord?

69,One source of problems for assignment 1,classicalcomp-001,social,"I think there's a reason for some of the difficulties some have had with the first assignment. Many people are trying to make it more interesting than it can be at this stage of the course. Given a melody and a defined harmony and the requirement that all chords be in root position, you just can't get very creative. And if you do try to get creative, you end up doubling something other than the root, doing parallel fifths, or otherwise breaking the rules. If you just follow the rules you'll end up with something smooth and boring, but that's OK. At this point, it's the limitations of the exercise and what we've covered so far that make it dull, not lack of a desire to be creative. So go for stolid and dull and you can't go wrong. 
Well said! I confess having broken your advice for the opening measure, but as a compositional exercise, you are quite right! The discipline of keeping to the rules will make the strategic decision (later on) to depart from them more helpful and constructive, rather than accidental and unfortunate.  Here is my knowing ""sin""!:      
 Doubling the fifth is less common than doubling the root, but still permitted in this style.

74,Lesson 3 - Chord Substitution,classicalcomp-002,resolves,"Please ignore question #3. Â It is explained in 5'0"" - 5'7"" that the parenthesis designate the use of the circle of fifths. Â But I have a new question:  4. Can the other direction of circle of fifths be used in the chord progression, i.e. I -> V -> ii -> vi -> iii -> viio -> IV -> I?
Thank you, Amilcar, for the explanation. Â How about my last question?
Another way to look at the tonal functions is to divide chords into three groups: 1) Subdominant #MATH Dominant group: iii, V, vii. Theoretically, any member of a group can substitute corresponding function, ii, I and vii being the most characteristic representatives, and vi and iiiÂthe least representative and, in fact, bi-functional. But there are also considerations of style. For Viennese classics, ii and IV are  the  subdominants and V and vii O Â the  dominants. 
For instance, the opening section in Prokofiev's Op. 59 No. 1 #MATH. Cannot imagine this in Viennese context though. Not sure about Baroque.<br /><br />Try playing I Â IV^6_4 Â iii7 Â I. iii makes quite a decent dominant in this progression, after all.<br />
After viewing the video a second time, I have some questions.  1. About chord substitution which is discussed in 3'34"" to 4'39"". Â The ii chord is a possible substitution for IV chord, and the viio chord is a possible substitution for the V chord because they are a third apart. Â By the same argument why can't the V chord be a possible substitution for the iii chord, and the ii chord be a possible substitution for the viio chord?  2. Why can a iii chord be followed by a IV chord, but a vi chord cannot be followed by a viio chord, or a V chord be followed by a vi chord?  3. Why are the two left most chords enclosed in parentheses?
1. The V chord or dominant chord usually precedes the I chord or tonic, as does the vii. So they both lead to the I chord.Â  2. vi to vii to I sounds terrible. V to vi is heading to the related minor and implies a change of key. 4. The movement in fifths implies a stronger harmony. 2nds are also strong. 3rds and are less strong. Moving in the opposite direction is weaker in terms of the tonic. Play your progression, it sounds like it goes nowhere. The reason is there is very little movement between the voices.There are 1 to 2 voices that stay the same for each changing chord. Going in the opposite direction, you change 2 voices per chord, and the change in movement implies progression.Â 
What. V-vi is commonly used. Even our ""Compendium of Progressions"" has a I-V6-vi-iii6 progression and mentions a ""tonic substitution"" that changes V-I to V-vi.<br /><br />vi to vii to I... I would try to look at it as a variation of vi-V56-I. So it's probably not <em>that</em> terrible...","Thank you, Amilcar, for the explanation. Â How about my last question?

Sorry, but I can't find any quiz for week 1--unless you are referring to the 1 or 2 questions imbedded in the lectures. 
Erica, Yes, the quiz due dates are correct.

Also, with regard to assignment due dates, it is a good idea to make sure you have the correct time zone set for your geographic area. If you look at the due date for quiz 1 you will see a time zone. If this is not the correct time zone for where you live, you can change it. Â You do this by going to the down arrow next to your name at the very top right of the page, then clicking on Settings. There is a setting for time zone. The best advice is that given by Paul, which is to try to get the work done well before the due date...but you won't be penalized as long as you complete your assignments by the given due date.

Don't pay any attention to those due dates. Â Instead, move everything up to the week they were assigned, just as you supposed. Â That way you won't get behind.

77,How do I choose which bass tone?,classicalcomp-002,resolves,"The choice is usually fairly simple, since there are almost always only two options, and one can usually choose the less ""extreme"" (in pitch) of the two. If in open structure, I usually chose the option that was lower in pitch to give space for a lower Tenor voice, which spread out the SAT voices appropriately and helped with sonority. If in closed structure I sometimes chose the higher-pitched option, provided there was still space for the appropriate note in the Tenor and voices weren't crossing.
Choosing what octave the bass tone is in is really a matter of preference, just as long as it's the lowest note. The bass gets to operate fairly independently, so it's a matter of your own taste. I'm sure we all had some differences in our choices. 
The guideline I follow for selecting the Bass is to start with the root/note that gives the best sonority and refrain from Â voice crossing.
Another factor could be to choose a bass note that allows for contrary motion, as long as you're not violating other voice leading principles.
It would also depend on the instruments or voices you Â are using. Â Sometimes, you might want the lowest, or octave below, for clarity. Similar or the same instruments, you might want voice the notes close. Â Taking into account of the sound and harmonics of instruments used. Â In my own music, I sometimes move an instrument up/down an octave, to get more clarity in the arrangement.Â 
Throughout the voice leading lectures, the professor was choosing a bass tone for each chord.Â  However, as we went through the examples, I would occasionally choose the bass tone in a different octave than he chose.Â  How does one decide which octave to place the bass tone?

So, in lesson 7 part 2, in the 6th bar, when going from the V chord to the I chord - my solution to this was keeping the common tone (F over middle C), keeping the note that was supposed to be there (B over middle C), and having the D over middle C as my tenor voice. He doesn't talk about this possibility in the video, why not? Did he just want it to go there, and forget saying that what I did was a fine way to do it, or is it just not a good way to do it?
The closest note for the A is either Bb or F. A -> Bb would definetly be ideal... but three roots is a crowd. :D Moving A up to D is not moving to the closest chord note, and also results in moving from an open to a close structure.","Yeah, your solution does look good for me.
