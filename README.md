# NUS MOOC Transacts CORPUS
This is an annotated corpus of discussion forum threads from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The annotations are grounded on a pedagogy based discourse framework that codifies 'transactivity' (Berkowitz and Gibbs, 1983) and proposes a taxonomy of interventions.

We also propose inter-annotator agreement measures for a piecewise crowdsourcing annotation task to annotate the forum discussions with our proposed taxonomy of transactive interventions.

However, due to privacy concerns and copyright claimed by MOOC platforms such as Coursera.org, we have encrypted the data. We also reserve the rights for access, use and distribution of the data. 

All rights reserved.

For access and use please raise a github issue or write to cmkumar087@gmail.com kanmy@comp.nus.edu.sg. We will review your request and get back to you.
