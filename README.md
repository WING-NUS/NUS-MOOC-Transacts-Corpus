# NUS-MOOC-CORPUS
This is an annotated corpus of discussion forum threads from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The annotations are grounded on a pedagogy based discourse framework that codifies 'transactivity' (Berkowitz and Gibbs, 1983) and proposes a taxonomy of interventions.

However, due to privacy concerns and copyright claimed by MOOC platforms such as Coursera.org, we have encrypted the data.
